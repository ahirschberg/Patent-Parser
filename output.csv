﻿20070104, None, Disclosed herein is a method and apparatus of immobilizing a biocatalyst on a microfluidic biochip for conducting reactions in the presence of electroosmotic flow. The biochip includes a polymer on its microfluidic flow surfaces, wherein the polymer includes a first substituent selected from ionic groups of the same polarity or precursors thereof, a second substituent that is a hydrophobic group, and a third substituent comprising an immobilized biocatalyst- or precursor thereof. The biochip can be used to conduct multiple sequential biocatalyzed reactions in the presence of electroosmotic flow., None, None, 10351976, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None
20070104, None, Systems and methods for monitoring analytes in real time using integrated chromatography systems and devices. Integrated microfluidic liquid chromatography devices and systems include multiple separation columns integrated into a single substrate. Using such a device, parallel analysis of multiple samples can be performed simultaneously and/or sequential analysis of a single sample can be performed simultaneously on a single chip or substrate. The devices and systems are well suited for use in high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) applications. HPLC chips and devices including embedded parylene channels can be fabricated using a single mask process., None, None, 11404496, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None
20070104, None, A new class of materials for use in electric and electroluminescent devices having one or more phosphine oxide moieties bonded by single bonds to two outer groups. In embodiments having two or more phosphine oxide moieties, the two or more phosphine oxide moieties are further joined by a bridging group. By selecting appropriate bridging and outer groups, the new class of materials of the present invention enables designers to “tune” the electrical and electroluminescent characteristics of the materials. The phosphine oxide moiety restricts electron conjugation between the bridging and outer groups, isolating the bridging and outer groups from each other, and allowing the photophysical properties of the bridging and outer groups to be maintained in the molecule. The lowest energy component (bridging group or particular outer group) thus defines the triplet state, highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular energies for the entire molecule., None, None, 11035379, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None
20070104, None, This invention presents a process to produce bulk quantities of nanowires of a variety of semiconductor materials. Large liquid gallium drops are used as sinks for the gas phase solute, generated in-situ facilitated by microwave plasma. To grow silicon nanowires for example, a silicon substrate covered with gallium droplets is exposed to a microwave plasma containing atomic hydrogen. A range of process parameters such as microwave power, pressure, inlet gas phase composition, were used to synthesize silicon nanowires as small as 4 nm (nanometers) in diameter and several micrometers long. As opposed to the present technology, the instant technique does not require creation of quantum sized liquid metal droplets to synthesize nanowires. In addition, it offers advantages such as lower growth temperature, better control over size and size distribution, better control over the composition and purity of the nanowires., None, None, 11515051, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 10187460
