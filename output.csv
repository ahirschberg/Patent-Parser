None, 20010531, None, The present invention is for particulate compositions and methods for producing them that can absorb or scatter electromagnetic radiation. The particles are homogeneous in size and are comprised of a nonconducting inner layer that is surrounded by an electrically conducting material. The ratio of the thickness of the nonconducting layer to the thickness of the outer conducting shell is determinative of the wavelength of maximum absorbance or scattering of the particle. Unique solution phase methods for synthesizing the particles involve linking clusters of the conducting atoms, ions, or molecules to the nonconducting inner layer by linear molecules. This step can be followed by growth of the metal onto the clusters to form a coherent conducting shell that encapsulates the core., [ Steven J. Oldenburg][ Richard D. Averitt][ Nancy J.
