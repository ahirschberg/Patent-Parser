﻿20070104, None, A combustor ( 22 ) for a gas turbine ( 10 ) includes a main burner oxidizer flow path ( 34 ) delivering a first portion ( 32 ) of an oxidizer flow (e.g.,  16 ) to a main burner ( 28 ) of the combustor and a pilot oxidizer flow path ( 38 ) delivering a second portion ( 36 ) of the oxidizer flow to a pilot ( 30 ) of the combustor. The combustor also includes a flow controller ( 42 ) disposed in the pilot oxidizer flow path for controlling an amount of the second portion delivered to the pilot., None, None, 11173655, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None
