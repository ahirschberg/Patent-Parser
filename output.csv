20011227, None, 'A new and improved apparatus is disclosed which incorporates an air ventilation system into a standard toilet seat. The present invention would connect a filtration system to the rear half portion of a toilet seat by a plurality of ventilation pathways. The plurality of ventilation pathways would connect to two primary ventilation pathways located in the rear of a toilet seat, which in turn would connect to the filtration system via a house connection. The filtration system itself would be housed in a box-like container, with the container having two major compartments, a filter compartment and a fan compartment. The filter compartment would be accessible by a user and would allow a user to place a replaceable filter. The fan compartment, separated from the filter compartment by a divider membrane, would include a fan motor, with the fan motor including a fan, belt, and an electric motor. The belt would hook up the fan to the electric motor and would ensure rotation of the fan once the electric motor would be activated.
