<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, hydrometallurgical processes for the extraction of copper from ore have supplanted traditional pyrometallurgical methods. Pyrometallurgical methods involve the use of fire to extract pure metals from ore by smelting. Increased awareness of the environmental impact of these processes however have lead to an increase in environmental standards and the concomitant increase in the capital cost and operating cost of smelter equipment. Hydrometallurgical techniques have thus become a preferred method for the extraction of copper from copper ores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hydrometallurgical techniques involve the extraction or leaching of copper from copper ores into aqueous leach solutions. Ore is treated with aqueous solutions which dissolve the copper from the ore. Pure copper is then recovered from the leach solutions by solvent extraction and then electrowinning. Electrowinning is a process in which copper is plated onto an electrode from an aqueous solution containing high concentrations of isolated copper ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An efficient leaching system uses dilute solutions of sulfuric acid to extract copper from copper oxide and oxide/sulfide containing ores. Ferric (iron(III)) ions are often added to the acid solutions to improve the efficiency of the leaching process by oxidizing the copper (I) to its more soluble copper (II) form and sulfide to sulfur. The resulting leach solutions contain not only soluble copper and sulfate at low pH but they also contain a variety of metals including iron, manganese, aluminum, magnesium and molybdenum of which high concentrations of iron is the primary concern. Another efficient leaching system is chloride leaching. Chloride leaching is particularly effective at leaching copper from sulfide containing copper ores such as chalcopyrite. In this process ferric chloride is used as the source of chloride ions to complex the copper and to oxidize the copper (I) to copper (II) contributing to a high iron concentration in the leach solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The copper concentrations in the leach solutions can range from about, 1 gram/liter (g/L) to about 50 g/L with typical concentrations falling between 1 g/L and 6 g/L. The pH of these solutions ranges between 1.2 and 2.2 pH units. Copper concentrations in a typical electrowinning tank however are between about 30 g/L and 35 g/L. It is therefore necessary to extract and concentrate the copper in these mixed acid leaches before purifying the copper by electrowinning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The technology most widely used to extract and concentrate the copper in these mixed acid leach solutions is solvent extraction. In the solvent extraction process water soluble heavy metal salts are complexed with organic ligands to produce low polarity or neutral charge complexes that have limited solubility in water but are highly soluble in an organic solvent (organic phase) which is immiscible with water. Ligands such as aryl-hydroxyoximes are used for this purpose. These ligands selectively bind to the copper ions in the mixed metal solutions to create a charge neutral copper complex. These complexes are soluble in an organic solvent. Inthis way copper is selectively transferred into the organic phase. Salts can also be added to the aqueous phase to force the metal complexes into the organic phase. Other variations of this process incorporate ligands which form micelles in the aqueous phase or ligands which stay in the organic phase and are polar on one end and so are drawn to the aqueous-organic interface where they react with the metals to form non-polar organic soluble complexes soluble in the organic phase. When the organic phase becomes saturated with relatively high concentration of complexed copper, the copper must be decomplexed and released into the clean aqueous phase for final electrowinning. Some of the problems associated with the solvent extraction process include the necessity to execute multiple wash steps of the organic phase when chloride leach solutions are being treated; the need to add equilibrium modifiers to facilitate the uptake into and release of copper from organic phase and the formation of &ldquo;crud&rdquo; that forms at the aqueous-organic phase interface causing equipment fouling. Organic solvent and ligand loss further complicates the process. The primary drawback with this technology however is the organic phase. The solvents used in the organic phase include benzene, toluene, chloroform, hexanes and octanes among others. Kerosene is the solvent of choice for most large scale production mining operations. These solvents are typically toxic, flammable, and have adverse environmental inpacts. Solvent loss during the extraction process extracts a negative economic toll. Ligand and equilibrium modifier loss is also an environmental and economic problem associated with the solvent extraction process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An alternative to the solvent extraction processing of hydrometallurgical solutions is the use of swellable resin beads as an extraction medium. Swellable resin beads have a long history as the matrix on which ion exchange and metal ion chelation technologies are built. These swellable resin beads are generally lightly crosslinked polystyrene which is modified to accommodate the addition of pendant ion exchange or chelating ligands and occasionally other groups to decrease the hydrophobicity of the polymer. Copper selective ligands have been chemically bonded to polystyrene beads for the processing of copper leaches. There are however problems associated with using swellable resin bead technology in high throughput operations. Lightly crosslinked polystyrenebeads are highly porous and the extractant ligands are bound throughout the polymer matrix. Many, if not most, of the ligands are buried deep within the polymer bead. The feed solution must diffuse through the bead to reach these sites for extraction to take place. The required process flow rates are often much faster than the rate of diffusion through the resin bead. For this reason a material that may have a high capacity in a batch application where the extractant and the feed solution have long contact times has greatly reduced capacity in flow applications. Because of the porous nature of the resin beads they also have a tendency to collapse when subjected to the pressures generated by the fast moving solution in a column application. The beads at the exit end of the column flatten and pack more tightly together which in turn causes an increase in the backpressure of the system. This causes a decrease in metal ion capacity and necessitates periodic backwashing of the column thereby limiting the useful lifetime of the material. In addition, chloride is often present in the leach solution and will contaminate the strip solution. This contamination is not compatible with electrowinning. This is a problem with both the solvent extraction process and currently employed resin technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing it is apparent that the technical challenge posed in the recovery of high grade copper from low grade ore is to devise an efficient, environmentally safe method of selectively extracting copper from low concentration, low pH leach solutions to produce high concentration, high purity aqueous solutions suitable for electrowinning (i.e. free of ferric and chloride ions). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention is a matrix-polyamine based material that extracts and separates selected transition metal ions from iron (III) ions from a solution containing a mixture of metal ions. In a preferred embodiment, the subject extraction material selectively extracts copper (II) from low pH solutions in the presence of iron (III) ions. The matrix-polyamine based material is rigid and durable in order to withstand high throughput conditions and requires the use of no organic solvents in its use and only a few in its manufacture. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the matrix is silica gel which is washed with acid to maximize surface hydroxyl groups. The gel is then dried and partially rehydrated. The hydrated surface of the silica gel is reacted with a short chain trifunctional silane having hydrocarbon substituents containing 1-6 carbon atoms, trifunctional leaving groups on the silicon atom that provide sites for covalently bonding the hydrocarbylsilyl to the silica gel surface through Si&mdash;O bonds, and a terminal leaving group that provides a site for covalently bonding a polyamine to the hydrocarbylsilyl through carbon-nitrogen bonds. A polyamine is then reacted with the hydrocarbylsilyl formed from the silanization of the hydrated gel surface to form an aminohydrocarbyl polymer covalently bound to the silica gel surface. The silica-polyamine is then reacted with picolylchloride (2-chloromethyl pyridine) or with pyridine 2-carboxaldehyde to create a highly selective extraction material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A three step high throughput system using the silica-polyamine extraction material of the subject invention is also described. The first step of the process selectively extracts copper from leach solutions containing high concentrations of ferric ions with no added solution modifiers. The second step purges the extracted copper of chloride ions using a saturated solution of sodium sulfate or a dilute sulfuric acid solution. Thirdly, the copper is stripped from the extraction material with sulfuric acid to yield a concentrated copper solution suitable for electrowinning. The column is ready to be reloaded after rinsing with water.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention is a matrix-polyamine based material for the extraction of selected transition metals from iron (III) ions. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the matrix-polyamine based extraction material selectively extracts copper (II) ions from acidic solutions in the presence of iron (III) ions. Picolylchloride or pyridine 2-carboxaldehyde attached to a silica-polyamine base provides an extraction material that is highly selective for these copper ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The matrix-polyamine base is known and has been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,695,882 and 5,997,748. These patents are herein incorporated by reference. The surface of the matrix is chemically treated so as to covalently bind the reaction product of a polyamine with a hydrocarbylsilyl, such as the preferred haloalkylsilyl, to the matrix surface. This can be accomplished, for example, by first reacting a short chain trifunctional silane having a hydrocarbon substituent containing 1-6 carbon atoms and a terminal leaving group, such as a haloalkyl trifunctional silane, with the surface of the matrix in a manner such that the hydrocarbylsilyl is covalently bound with the matrix surface and then reacting a polyamine, such as polyethyleneimine, with the hydrocarbylsilyl to bind the polyamine to the hydrocarbylsilyl. The step of reacting the polyamine with the hydrocarbylsilyl must be such that it will yield multisite bound, but non-crosslinked, amino groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Briefly, the matrix-polyamine base material is prepared by boiling the matrix in acid, drying and partially rehydrating the matrix surface. In the exemplified embodiment, the matrix is silica gel. The silica gel surface can be hydrated by applying a moisturized atmosphere, such as air passed through a saturated aqueous sodium bromide solution, to the surface in a controlled environment until a predetermined humidification has been attained as determined by the mass increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The hydrated gel surface is then contacted with the above-defined short chain trifunctional silane, such as a haloalkyl trifunctional silane, in the presence of an inert organic solvent. The reaction between the hydrated surface of the silica gel and the silane produces a hydrocarbylsily that is covalently bonded to the gel surface by siloxanyl (Si&mdash;O) groups. After the reaction between the hydrated surface and the silane, the silanized gel is rinsed with an inert organic solvent and dried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The silanized and dried gel surface is then contacted with polyamine in the presence of an inert organic solvent or water to produce a multisite bound non-crosslinked polyamine coating on the matrix surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Suitable trifunctional groups on the silica of the silanizing agent include trichloro, trimethoxy, and triethoxy groups; trichloro being preferred. Suitable groups for the silanizing agent on the hydrocarbyl fragment include bromine, chlorine and iodine, tosylate, mesylate, brosylate, and triflate; bromine and chlorine being preferred. Suitable hydrocarbyl groups include short chain aliphatic hydrocarbons having 1-6 carbon atoms; propyl being preferred, based on pricing of the trichlorosilyl halide. A preferred molecular weight (M.W.) range for the polyamine is 300-60,000; with polyvinylamine or polyalylamine in that range being most preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Any number of suitable support materials may be substituted in place of the silica gel for use as an extraction material; silica gel merely being preferred because of its availability in sizes particularly suitable for use in continuous-flow extraction processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A particularly preferred matrix-polyamine base material comprises an alkylated silica gel where the silica gel surface is first reacted with a haloalkyltrichlorosilane and, then that reaction product is further reacted with polyvinylamine to yield a polyvinylaminoalkylsilyl activated surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The sequence of formulating the matrix-polyamine base material has some critical components. First, the matrix surface is washed with an acid, for example, nitric acid, dried and rehydrated to insure that a monolayer of water overlays the surface. Second, the clean and hydrated surface must be silanized before the polyamine is brought into the reaction. Polyamine addition is commenced only after the silanization procedure has been completed. By silanizing the hydrated surface with a silane having a short chain hydrocarbyl substituent containing 1-6 carbon atoms and a terminal leaving group, the surface to the matrix material will be virtually completely covered by Srf-O&mdash;Si-hydrocarbyl groups, where Srf represents the matrix surface, and by lateral Si&mdash;O&mdash;Si bonds. Hydration of the surface promotes the formation of these lateral bonds. The result is a horizontally polymerized matrix surface, covalently bound to the surface by Si&mdash;O bonds and cross-linked by Si&mdash;O&mdash;Si bonds with essentially few or no &mdash;OH groups left unreacted on the matrix&apos;s surface. The short hydrocarbyl chains extend from the laterally polymerized silyl groups and not from the matrix surface, and are not themselves cross-linked. As a consequence, of this form of silanization, the hydrocarbylated matrix surface becomes hydrolytically stable in both high and low pH solutions. Polyamine addition to the cross-linked, silanized surface anchors, results in the substitution of amino groups onto the ends of short hydrocarbyl chains without destabilizing either the matrix surface or the covalent bonds with the hydrocarbyl substituent. In the context of a preferred process, employing a short chain trifunctional alkyl silane containing 1-6 carbon atoms, the result is a densely alkylated extraction material surface, that is optimal for bonding amino groups and for addition of functionalizing groups or ligands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Selectivity for certain transition metal ions in the presence of ferric iron is achieved by the addition of a pyridine functional group to the matrix-polyamine base material. These pyridine functional groups can be a pyridine ring containing an alkyl chain with 1-4 carbons with a terminal halogen tosylate, mesylate, brosylate and triflate or a pyridine ring containing an alkyl chain with 1-4 carbons with a terminal aldehyde. Synthesis of matrix-polyamine/amino or imino pyridine extraction material is accomplished in two ways. The first way (Method A) converts the pyridine nitrogen of the picolylchloride hydrochloride salt from the acid form to the free base form using a strong base. In a preferred embodiment, potassium hydroxide is used as the base. The free base pyridine moiety of picolylchloride is then separated from the resulting salt before adding it to the matrix-polyamine base. In the second step the solution containing the free base pyridine moiety is added to the matrix-polyamine/methanol slurry. In a second embodiment triethylamine is used as the base. The triethylamine, the pyridine containing ligand and the matrix-polyamine material are all combined in a single reaction. In this embodiment the base is used to convert the pyridine containing ligand to the free base form and scavenge the acid formed during the reaction. The resulting 2-picolylamine polyamine is shown in Formula 1. The second way (Method B) involves the addition of pyridine 2-carboxaldehyde directly to silica-polyamine. A slurry of the silica polyamine and an organic solvent is heated for several hours at 60-90&deg; C. Method B yields 2-pyrindine carboximine polyamine shown in Formula 2.

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Properties afforded the extraction material of the subject invention through this synthetic route include long material lifetime, high capacities for many heavy metal ions, selectivity for heavy metal ions with no interference from alkali or alkaline earth metals, the ability to extract these metal ions at high flow rates to very low levels, the ability to release these captured metals in highly concentrated solutions and most importantly selectivity for copper ions in the presence of other transition metals ions including ferric ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The advantageous properties of the subject material are revealed by performance defining tests. These tests can be divided into two broad categories, batch tests and flow tests. Batch tests are conducted b subjecting a predetermined amount of extraction material to a predetermined amount of feed solution for a set amount of time. Batch tests are used to determine capture kinetics, absorption isotherms, and pH profiles. Flow tests are conducted by flowing the feed solution through the extractant. Flow tests elucidate how the materials will perform under process conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The gel containing the picolyl group was tested under flow conditions to determine its ability to separate copper from ferric iron. The feed solution, a simulated or leach solution, contained a 1:3 weight ratio of copper (II) to iron (III). The copper was added as copper (II) sulfate and the iron as iron (III) chloride, this formulation produced a chloride ion element in the solution as well as the heavy metals to further simulate leach solutions. The solution was used at its intrinsic pH of &tilde;1.2. The feed solution was applied to a column containing silica-polyvinylamine/picolyl gel. The feed solution was allowed to flow through the column. A strip solution of sulfuric acid was used to release metal captured and held on the gel surface. The results of these preliminary flow tests revealed that the strip solution contained a ratio of approximately 100:1 copper to iron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Early trials however revealed a significant chloride ion concentration in the strip solution. The gel has a very high binding affinity for copper, for the material made by Method A concentrated sulfuric acid or 4N acid heated to 70&deg; C. is required to completely strip the copper from the gel. The material made by Method B can be stripped with 4N acid. A second series of trials was carried out with the objective of reducing the chloride ion content of the eluant or strip solution. To accomplish this saturated sodium sulfate solution was pumped through the column after it was loaded with copper from the simulated leach solution. The gel was then stripped with concentrated sulfuric acid and the strip solution was analyzed. The chloride ion content in the strip solution was below detection using ion chromatography. The sodium sulfate solution was analyzed for copper and was found to contain only low concentrations of the metal, for example, 23 ppm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The matrix-polyamine/picolyl extraction material of the subject invention provides a basis on which to build an environmentally friendly, efficient system, to extract copper from acidic low copper concentration leach solutions and produce a highly concentrated high purity copper solution suitable for electrowinning. A three step high throughput system provides high purity copper from low concentration leach solutions. The first step of the process selectively extracts copper from leach solutions containing high concentrations of ferric ions with no added solution modifiers. The second step purges the extracted copper of chloride ions using a saturated solution of sodium sulfate or dilute sulfuric acid solution. Thirdly, the copper is stripped from the extraction material with sulfuric acid to yield a concentrated copper solution suitable for electrowinning. The column is ready to be reloaded after rinsing with water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The economic benefits realized from this process are elimination of cost associated with solvent and ligand loss, predicted decreased energy consumption and predicted decreased processing time relative to the solvent extraction systems currently in use. Major environmental benefits are realized with the elimination of organic solvents from the process. Major economic advantages over currently available chelator resins are lower material cost and longer usable lifetimes. </paragraph>

Amorphous silica gel (such as Crosfield, 90-105 microns (&mgr;m), 150 &angst; pore size with 375 meters<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/grams (g) surface area) (200 g) was mixed with 1N nitric acid (800 milliliters (mL)) in a 2 liter (L) three-necked round bottom flask. The contents were degassed for two minutes (min). After degassing, the flask was put into a heating well and a reflux condenser, a thermometer and a mechanical stirrer were attached to the flask. The contents of the flask were stirred and heated at 100&deg; F. for 6 hours (hr). At the end of the 6 hr heating, the contents were cooled to room temperature and dumped into a 3 L sintered glass funnel. The gel was washed three times, 800 mL each, with deionized (DI) water. The gel was further washed with methanol three times (800 mL each). After most of the methanol was removed, the gel was spread in an open pan and air dried over night. The air-dried gel in the pan was placed in an oven and dried at 120&deg; F. for 2-4 hr until constant weight was reached. Typical weight lost during this acid wash is about 6.4-7.1%. </paragraph>

At that time an aliquot of the metal ion solution was removed for analysis and preserved with trace metal grade nitric acid. This test was carried out in triplicate to ensure reliability of the data. The collected samples were then diluted to bring the metal concentrations into a range which could be analyzed by FAA spectroscopy. After standing 24 hr at an elevated pH (2.0) the high iron (III) concentration solutions began to form iron (III) precipitates. Negative values appear because, at the higher iron (III) concentrations, more iron (III) precipitated out from the control solutions than from the samples containing the extraction materials. </paragraph>

The absorbence data from the FAA was converted to millimoles of metal ion per g of extractive material and plotted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows that at 1500 cycles both materials seem to have retained their capacity for copper (II) and rejection for iron (III). It is also clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> that at a flow rate of 2 column volumes/min 90-105 micron D2P-PVA has a higher copper (II) capacity than XFS. D2P-PVA also has a greater separation power demonstrated by the distance between the copper (II) and iron (III) lines of the graph. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to electrical structures and processes for forming electrical devices, and more particularly, to electrical structures and processes for forming electrical devices having organic layers chemically bonded to a silicon-containing surface. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Obtaining acceptable electrical properties of semiconductor surfaces is critical to the performance of many semiconductor-based electrical devices. Surface electrical properties become especially important as devices shrink in size, because the surface-to-volume ratio of the device components becomes higher and surfaces play a more important role in the overall device properties. In general, surfaces of crystalline solids are sites of electrical defects because the atoms at the surface do not experience the same bonding as atoms in the bulk of the crystalline material. Structurally or electrically defective surface sites are generally denoted as surface states or dangling bonds. Reduction of surface states is an important feature in improving the performance of electrical devices because such reduction lowers the level of electrical defects and provides improved electrical device properties of the resulting device structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Surface states that form electrical defects are a particularly important issue for silicon-based electrical devices. When silicon is exposed to air, a native oxide forms on the surface of the silicon. This native oxide contains a significant density of surface states at the interface between the crystalline silicon and the native oxide. These surface states allow electrons and holes to combine thereby reducing the current flow through the electrical device. The poor electrical properties of such surfaces are manifested in many physical properties of electronic devices formed form such materials. Some of these electrical properties include the surface recombination velocity, which represents the rate at which electrons and holes recombine at the surface of the device, the lifetime of charge carriers in the device, the excess interface capacitance due to charge carriers residing in residual dangling bonds at the device surfaces, the open circuit voltage of photovoltaic devices, the rectification ratio and leakage current of semiconductor/metal Schottky diodes, the voltage-versus current gain properties of metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors, and a variety of other electrical properties of such electronic devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Some methods to passivate the surface of crystalline silicon to reduce the number of dangling bonds and to reduce the surface state density, thereby obtaining improved electrical devices through improvements in the properties of the surface of the silicon, have been explored in the past. A H-terminated silicon substrate can be formed upon exposure of the crystalline silicon to hydrogen gas, to a hydride-containing reducing agent, or to aqueous acids. However, the H-terminated silicon-containing surface is not stable in the presence of air. Similarly, halogens have been used to form halogen-covered silicon-containing surfaces, but such surfaces likewise suffer from a similar instability in air. In addition, such surfaces have poor surface recombination velocities in contact with air, allowing electrons which should be flowing as electrical current to recombine with holes thereby providing inferior electrical properties of the resulting devices and device structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Silicon can be covered with a thermally grown oxide formed under controlled conditions such that there is a low interface state density at the resulting silicon/silicon dioxide interface. However, silicon dioxide is an electrical insulator and often the thickness of this insulator is too great for formation of certain electrical device structures, in which little or no silicon oxide is desired on the silicon-containing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Formation of silicon oxides requires high temperatures, and often these high temperatures interfere with previous device processing acts which cannot tolerate high processing temperatures. The exposure to high temperature required for form the silicon dioxide, therefore, produces degraded performance from the resulting electrical device or requires an alteration in the flow of process acts to form the final desired device structure. In addition, silicon dioxide has too low of a dielectric constant for use in certain device structures in which a layer having a high dielectric constant but a low surface state density at the interface with the silicon is desired for good electrical device performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, during formation of electrical devices, formation of too much silicon oxide or exposure of the surface to undesired contaminants may adversely affect device performance. If too much native silicon oxide is formed, a subsequent contact metalization may make poor electrical contact, if any, to the substrate. Likewise, too much silicon oxide may prevent diffusion of dopant from an overlying layer into the substrate. To reduce these effects, many manufacturing sites have queue times between acts. Unfortunately, queue times are difficult to implement in manufacturing. A backlog of work at a piece of equipment or equipment downtime may make queue time compliance very difficult to administer. Reliability, reproducibility, and other concerns typically follow from the use of queue times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Organic layers have been formed that are bonded to porous silicon. Crystalline silicon does not emit visible light. Unlike crystalline silicon, porous silicon emits visible light and chemically modified porous silicon structures can have acceptable photoluminescence properties. Chemical modification of oxide-coated crystalline silicon surfaces has been used to form electrochemical devices and sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Although the existing methods of forming silicon-containing surfaces have some usefulness, there still remains a need in the art for silicon-containing surfaces that have good electrical properties and/or are chemically passivated. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An organic passivating layer that is chemically bonded to a silicon-containing surface may be used to improve the electrical properties of silicon-based electronic materials and to improve the properties of electrical devices resulting from the use of such materials. In different embodiments, the organic passivating layer may remain within finished devices to reduce dangling bonds, improve carrier lifetimes, decrease surface recombination velocities, allow controlled spacing on the molecular scale between various other layers in the device, or to increase the electronic efficiencies of the surfaces and devices. In other embodiments, the organic passivating layer may be used as a protective sacrificial layer which ultimately reduces contact resistance or which ultimately reduces the resistance of doped regions in the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one set of embodiments, an electrical structure comprises a crystalline material comprising silicon, wherein the crystalline material has a surface, and an organic layer is chemically bonded to the surface of the crystalline material. An electrical property of the electrical structure may be significantly different compared to the same structure without the organic layer. In another set of embodiments, a process can be used to form an electrical device that includes the electrical structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another set of embodiments, the organic layer can be used as a reactive layer to form another organic or inorganic layer having desired properties, in which the second layer is physically and chemically separated from the underlying silicon substrate by the organic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In still another set of embodiments, a process for forming an electrical device may comprise forming a patterned insulating layer over at least a portion of the electrical device. The patterned insulating layer can define an opening. A silicon-containing region may have an exposed portion at the opening. The silicon-containing region may be at least part of an electrical component within the electrical device. The process can also comprise forming an organic layer chemically bonded to the surface of the silicon-containing region. The process can further comprise removing the organic layer and forming a metal-containing layer after removing the organic layer. At least a portion of the metal-containing layer may contact the exposed portion of the silicon-containing region, and the metal-containing layer may be part of an electrical connection to the silicon-containing region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In still another set of embodiments, a process for forming an electrical device can comprise forming a patterned insulating layer over at least of the electrical device. The patterned insulating layer may define an opening. A silicon-containing region may be an exposed portion at the opening, and the silicon-containing region may be at least part of an electrical component within the electrical device. The process can also comprise forming an organic layer chemically bonded to the surface of the crystalline material. The process can further comprise removing the organic layer and forming a dopant-source layer that may contact the exposed portion of the silicon-containing region. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Skilled artisans appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts (elements). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Electrical structures and devices may be formed and include an organic passivating layer that is chemically bonded to silicon to improve the electrical properties of electrical devices. In different embodiments, the organic passivating layer may remain within finished devices to reduce dangling bonds, improve carrier lifetimes, decrease surface recombination velocities, increase capacitance, or provide improvements in other electronic properties, such as voltage. In other embodiments, the organic passivating layer may be used as a protective sacrificial layer and reduce the contact resistance or reduce the resistance of doped regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Attention is now directed to specific embodiments. The semiconductor substrate includes silicon atoms but may also include other Group IVA atoms, such as germanium, carbon, or the like. The semiconductor substrate may be substantially monocrystalline and have its primary surface along the (100), (111), or other crystal plane. The substrate may be formed using a Czochralski-grown or float-zone process. The semiconductor substrate may also include an epitaxial layer overlying a semiconductor bulk material, semiconductor-on-insulator, polycrystalline semiconductor material, amorphous semiconductor material, or the like. Each of these materials typically includes silicon atoms. In many embodiments, the silicon-containing substrates, materials, or layers are silicon substrates, silicon materials, or silicon layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Crystalline silicon can be transformed through etching or physical processing to produce a layer of material having at least 30% porosity and a collection of nanometer-sized physical protrusions, with such material having distinct physical and optical properties and commonly denoted as porous silicon. Crystalline silicon does not emit visible light and is useful in many electrical devices. Unlike crystalline silicon, porous silicon emits visible light and chemically modified porous silicon structures can have acceptable photoluminescence properties. Chemical modification of oxide-coated crystalline silicon surfaces has been used to form electrochemical devices and sensors. A portion of the silicon-containing material in electrical devices immediately adjacent to the organic layer may have a porosity less than approximately 30 percent. In another embodiment, the porosity may be no greater than approximately 10 percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The organic layer can contain a variety of functional groups in broad ranges of chemical classes that are considered members of organic molecules, such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, dienes, alicyclic hydrocarbons, arenes, alcohols, ethers, ketones, aldehydes, carbonyls, carbanions, polynuclear aromatics and derivatives of such organics (e.g., halide derivatives, etc.), biomolecules, such as sugars, isoprenes and isoprenoids, fatty acids and derivatives, etc.. Other functional groups and examples of members of organic layers are listed below in Table 1. The groups previously described and those in Table 1 are merely to illustrate and not limit the present invention.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes an illustration of an organic layer formed over silicon atoms within a semiconductor substrate. To form the chemically bonded organic passivation layer, the silicon-containing surface is chemically reacted with a reagent or with a series of reagents to produce an organic layer that is chemically bonded to the silicon-containing surface. The reactions may occur in the gas phase, liquid phase, or solid phase to produce layers in which there is a chemical bond between the silicon-containing surface and the resulting organic layer. The chemical bonding between the silicon and the organic layer is typically covalent bonding but may be ionic or electrostatic in character as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The organic layer is illustrated by the letter &ldquo;R.&rdquo; The organic layer may include carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, or other similar elements. Most (over half) of the atoms within the organic layer are typically carbon and hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> R may be selected from a group called alkyl, allyl, polymer, or other organic materials. The linkage to the silicon can be formed by a bond from silicon to oxygen bonded to carbon, as in an alkoxide, from a bond from silicon to phosphorus, nitrogen, sulphur, or other species that also are linked to organic groups. For an alkoxide, the Si&mdash;R bonds would be replaced by Si&mdash;O&mdash;R bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The organic layer over the semiconductor substrate may include a monolayer of a hydrocarbon group (alkyl, allyl, alkoxide, etc.) or may include a significantly thicker polymer layer. The organic layer may have functional groups as described in Table 1 structurally within the layer or at the terminus of the layer. Therefore, the thickness of the organic layer may vary from approximately 0.3 nm to over one micron. For embodiments where a monolayer is to be formed, the thickness generally will not exceed approximately 9 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the silicon-containing surface is first chemically etched to produce a H-terminated silicon-containing surface. The etching can occur in the liquid or gaseous phases and can be performed with a variety of reagents. For example, the silicon-containing surface may be etched in approximately 40 percent ammonium fluoride (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>F) aqueous solution to yield a hydrogen-terminated (&ldquo;H-terminated&rdquo;) surface along the primary surface of the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the silicon-containing surface is cleaned in vacuum and consequently &ldquo;activated&rdquo; or made reactive chemically towards further reagents. Alternatively, the surface can be heated, bombarded with ions or electrons or otherwise cleaned to expose a reactive silicon-containing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The reactive silicon-containing surface is then reacted with a reagent, or with a series of reagents, to produce an organic layer that is chemically bonded to the silicon-containing surface. The organic reagent can be reacted directly with an activated, reactive silicon-containing surface, or the organic reagent can be reacted with a silicon-containing surface prepared in an intermediate state that is reactive towards the organic reagent used to form organic layer that is chemically bonded to the silicon-containing surface. The reactions can be performed in the gas phase, liquid phase, or in the solid state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an organic reagent, such as an olefin, can be reacted with the cleaned reactive silicon-containing surface to form a silicon-carbon bonded species. Similarly, molecules with two double bonds can be used in a Diels-Alder reaction to form chemical bonds with the silicon-containing surface. Other methods of forming silicon-carbon bonds from reactive silicon-containing surfaces in vacuum are also useful and will be known to those skilled in the art. Similarly, the silicon-containing surface can be reacted with sulfur or oxygen-containing organic reagents having functional groups that will react with the silicon-containing surface to form a chemically-bonded organic layer on the resulting silicon-containing surface. Such functionality can include alcohols, which can form silicon oxygen bonds that tether the organic group to the silicon-containing surface, thiols, amines, and other reactive organic reagents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, organic reagents can be exposed to etched H-terminated silicon substrates. Such reagents can include double bonds in conjunction with ultraviolet light, radical initiators, or heat, which form silicon carbon bonds to the silicon-containing surface. For example, the semiconductor substrate may be exposed to an organometallic compound having a general composition that includes bonding of the type R-M-X, where R is an organic group, M is a metal atom, and X is a halogen atom. The hydrocarbon group R may be an alkyl group having one to twenty carbon atoms, although more carbon atoms on the alkyl group may be used. M may include magnesium, copper, thallium, aluminum, zinc, or the like. X may include chlorine, bromine, iodine, or the like. A specific embodiment can utilize Grignard reagents, where M is magnesium and X is chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The organometallic reagent can react with the silicon-containing surface to form an organic layer that is chemically bonded to the silicon-containing surface. Alternatively, an alkyl-lithium reagent (or other reagents of the formula R-M) may be used in place of the Grignard reagent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment, the alkyl group may be formed by terminal olefin reduction with the H-terminated silicon-containing surface. For example, after forming a H-terminated surface of the semiconductor substrate, the substrate may be immersed in approximately equal volumes of CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&boxH;C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>2n </subscript></highlight>(n&equals;5, 7, 9, etc.) and approximately 1.0 M ethyl aluminum chloride (EtAlCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) in a hexane solution at approximately room temperature (17-25&deg; C.) for a time period in a range of approximately 10-14 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In still another set of embodiments, an alkoxide group may be formed instead of an alkyl group. The alkoxide group may include &mdash;OCH3, &mdash;OC2H5, or the like. For example, a H-terminated semiconductor substrate may be exposed to an alcoholic halogen or alcoholic ferrocenium solution to form the alkoxide group. Alternatively, an anodic electrical current can be used to accomplish the reaction of the silicon-containing surface to form the chemically bonded silicon alkoxide species. In another embodiment, a metal alkoxide (M-O&mdash;R) may be used. The metal may include lithium, potassium, or the like. R may be an alkyl group (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, or the like) or an allyl group and may contain other functionality including fluorine, chlorine, or other organic functional groups such as those listed in Table 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the hydrogen-terminated silicon-containing surface can be transformed into an intermediate surface that is then reactive with an organic reagent to form the desired chemically-bonded organic layer on the silicon-containing surface. An embodiment of such an intermediate surface is obtained by using a halogen source to convert the reactive silicon-containing surface or the H-terminated silicon-containing surface into a halogen-terminated silicon-containing surface. Chlorination may be performed using phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or chlorine (Cl2) gas. Alternatively, other halogens or halogen sources including bromine (e.g., Br2, HBr, etc.), iodine (I2, CHI3, etc.), fluorine, or other reagents that produce reactive intermediate surfaces may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The reactive intermediate surface can then be exposed to the organic reagent to produce the desired chemical bonding between the silicon and the organic species. Organometallic materials may be used and include methyl magnesium chloride (CH3MgCl), methyl magnesium bromide (CH3MgBr), n-octyl magnesium bromide (C8H17MgBr), or the like. In this reaction, the halogen atoms are replaced by the hydrocarbon group from the organometallic compound to form an organic layer that is chemically bonded to the surface of the semiconductor substrate. In general, removal of the halogen-containing intermediate layer to form a covalently bonded organic layer can be done using a variety of methods, including organometallic reagents, such as Grignards and organolithium compounds, organocopper compounds, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the halogen-terminated silicon-containing surface can be exposed to alkoxides or to other reagents that will produce chemical bonds between the silicon and the organic group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a halogen-terminated semiconductor substrate may be exposed to an allyl-M-X compound to form an allyl-terminated semiconductor substrate surface. Other organic functionality can also be introduced into the organic layer using similar methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the chemically bonded organic group can be transformed by subsequent chemical reaction into another chemically bonded organic species. For example, an allyl group may be formed from an alkyl group. The alkyl-terminated semiconductor substrate surface may be formed using any of the processes previously described. The alkyl-terminated semiconductor substrate may be exposed to a halide including chlorine, bromine, or the like and ultraviolet light to form a halogenated alkyl group. The semiconductor substrate with the halogenated alkyl group may be exposed to a base in the presence of alcohol. The base may include potassium hydroxide (KOH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), or the like. The reaction can form an allyl-terminated semiconductor substrate surface, a halide salt (KX, NH4X, or the like), and water. In one specific embodiment, the allyl group typically has three to nine carbon atoms. In still other embodiments, more than nine carbon atoms may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In another example, the chemically bonded organic group can be used as the initiation site of formation of another, second layer, which can be either physically attached or chemically bonded onto the chemically bonded organic layer. The second layer can be a metal, semiconductor, or insulator that is physically sputtered, electrodeposited, evaporated, spin-coated, sprayed, or otherwise physically deposited onto the organic layer. Alternatively, the second layer can be chemically reacted to become attached by formation of chemical bonds to the organic layer that is chemically bonded to the silicon substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the second layer is an organic polymer that is chemically bonded to the organic layer that is chemically bonded to the silicon. For example, the allyl group may be used to form a polymeric layer that is chemically bonded to the semiconductor substrate through the first said organic layer acting as a linker. The thickness of the polymer film can be at least approximately one nm and can exceed 100 nm or even one &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Insulating organic materials that can be used for such purposes can include, for example: main-chain carbon polymers, such as poly(dienes), poly(alkenes), poly(acrylics), poly(methacrylics), poly(vinyl ethers), poly(vinyl thioethers), poly(vinyl alcohols), poly(vinyl ketones), poly(vinyl halides), poly(vinyl nitrites), poly(vinyl esters), poly(styrenes), poly(aryines), and the like; main-chain acyclic heteroatom polymers, such as poly(oxides), poly(caronates), poly(esters), poly(anhydrides), poly(urethanes), poly(sulfonate), poly(siloxanes), poly(sulfides), poly(thioesters), poly(sulfones), poly(sulfonamindes), poly(amides), poly(ureas), poly(phosphazens), poly(silanes), poly(silazanes), and the like; and main-chain heterocyclic polymers, such as poly(furantetracarboxylic acid diimides), poly(benzoxazoles), poly(oxadiazoles), poly(benzothiazinophenothiazines), poly(benzothiazoles), poly(pyrazinoquinoxalines), poly(pyromenitimides), poly(quinoxalines), poly(benzimidazoles), poly(oxidoles), poly(oxoisinodolines), poly(diaxoisoindoines), poly(triazines), poly(pyridzaines), poly(pioeraziness), poly(pyridines), poly(pioeridiens), poly(triazoles), poly(pyrazoles), poly(pyrrolidines), poly(carboranes), poly(oxabicyclononanes), poly(diabenzofurans), poly(phthalides), poly(acetals), poly(anhydrides), carbohydrates, and the like.

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Other methods for modifying a silicon-containing surface to produce chemically bonded organic layers may include alkylation using addition of olefins to the H-terminated surface induced by UV irradiation, free-radical initiation, thermal activation, or hydrosilylation, direct reaction of the H-terminated surface with bromine-containing Grignard reagents, and activation using anodic or cathodic electrochemical processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, the silicon-containing surface can be activated through formation of Si&mdash;N, Si&mdash;S, or Si&mdash;O bonds through reaction of a X-terminated silicon-containing surface with amines, thiols, or alcohols, respectively. Additionally, reaction of H-terminated, single-crystal Si to form Si&mdash;O bonds that provide the linkages to organic groups bonded to the silicon-containing surface can be achieved by photoelectrochemical reaction with carboxylic acids, photochemical reaction with aldehydes, thermal reaction with aldehydes, and thermal reactions with alcohols with or without dissolved oxidants. Reactions of an olefin with a surface-propagated radical chain reaction on the H-terminated surface can also be used. In still other embodiments, ion bombardment (e.g., ion implantation using Si<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Ar<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, or the like) can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The electrical properties of the silicon-containing surface that has been modified with the chemically bonded organic layer can be monitored through a variety of electrical measurements on the silicon-containing surface or through measurements on electronic devices resulting from the use of the modified surface in the formation of electronic devices. A method that provides information on the electrical properties of the modified silicon-containing surface itself is to measure the surface recombination velocity using a contactless measurement technique.

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Initially (substantially no air exposure), the data for the one-act olefin reduction are better compared to two-act chlorination/alkylation. However, the one-step olefin reduction process has decreased lifetimes and increase surface recombination velocities when air exposure time increases. At approximately 10 minutes of air exposure, the two-act process gives better electronic performance compared to the one-act process. Still, the one-act process has utility and can be used, particularly if air exposure is relatively short. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In still another non-limiting example for a polymer film, an olefin-terminated silicon-containing surface (as previously formed as described above with respect to the polymer general examples) can react with an olefin metathesis catalyst &lsqb;(Cy<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ru&boxH;CHPh, Cy&equals;cyclohexyl&rsqb; (&ldquo;compound 1&rdquo;) by immersing the samples for a time period in a range of approximately 2.5-3.5 hours into an approximately 25 millimolar solution of compound 1 in CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The samples may be rinsed several times with CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to remove any non-bound catalyst. Exposure of the surface-bound catalyst to an approximately 0.01-2.44 M solution of the norbornene monomer for a time period in a range of 25-35 minutes in 1,2-dichloroethane can result in the growth of a polymeric film on the silicon-containing surfaces of the semiconductor substrate. Polynorbornene films between 0.9 and 5500 nm in thickness can be produced through the use of 0.01 to 2.44 M solutions of norbornene monomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Because polymerization initiated by compound 1 is a controlled polymerization process, different film thicknesses can be obtained by varying the concentration of norbornene monomer in 1,2-dichloroethane solutions. Table 5 summarizes the thicknesses of several polymer films that may be produced at a fixed reaction time (approximately 30 minutes) for various concentrations of monomer in the solution. The standard deviation in the thickness data measured at six different spots for each sample may be less than approximately &plusmn;10% of the mean value, indicating that the polymer film covers substantially all the silicon-containing semiconductor substrate.

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As can be seen by the data in Table 6, an alkoxylation reaction can occur in the iodine-alcohol solution. An XP (X-ray photoelectron) survey spectrum obtained on surfaces that had been immersed into CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>OH-0.05 M I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and then rinsed with CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>OH showed approximately 0.2-0.3 monolayer of persistently-bound iodine, while scans of the Si 2 p region showed the formation of approximately 0.2-0.3 monolayer of partially oxidized Si at 102.6 BeV (binding electron volts). The amount, position, and shape of this 102.6 BeV peak is virtually identical to that of the oxidized Si peak observed for silicon-containing surfaces that are exposed to CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>OH-0.2 M FcBF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. From the data, at least some, but not all, of the silicon surface is bonded to a methoxy group (&mdash;OCH3). More of the silicon at the surface is bonded to the methoxy groups if a ferrocenium solution is used, and such surfaces produce longer lifetimes and lower surface recombination velocities, S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Specific examples of chemicals and some other alkoxylation reaction details are given below. Five combinations of crystal orientation and alkoxylations (with approximate reaction temperatures and reaction times in parentheses, performed in the presence of a one-electron oxidant, a halogen, or from a reactive silicon-containing surface) may include: (100)-oriented Si with approximately 1 M LiOCH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>OH (80&deg; C., 21.5 hours), (100)-oriented Si with approximately 1 M LiOCD<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-CD<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>OD (70&deg; C., 23.5 hours), (111)-oriented Si with approximately 1 M LiOCH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>OH (75&deg; C., 19 hours), (111)-oriented Si with approximately 1 M LiOCD<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-CD<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>OD (70&deg; C., 19 hours), and (111)-oriented Si with approximately 1 M LiO(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-THF prepared by adding approximately 7.5 mL of approximately 2.5 M LiC<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9 </subscript></highlight>in a hexane solution to approximately 2.6 mL of HO(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in approximately 20 mL of THF (80&deg; C., 15.5 hours). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The organic passivation layer may have uses in many different types of electrical structures and devices. In some of the applications, the organic layer may be useful in helping to improve or otherwise significantly alter or change the electrical properties of the electronic device or semiconductor device including discrete components or integrated circuits. In other applications, the chemically-bonded organic layer may be useful to help reduce the likelihood of oxidizing or contaminating a semiconductor surface between processing acts. The organic layer may help to lengthen queue times or potentially eliminate the queue times. The embodiments below better illustrate these features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes an illustration of a cross-sectional view of a portion of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes a heavily doped p-type region <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, a relatively lightly doped p-type region <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, and a heavily doped n-type region <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> at the surface <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>. Such an electronic structure may be used as part of a photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Heavily doped regions may have dopant concentrations of at least approximately 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>atoms per cubic centimeter (to provide ohmic contacts) and lightly doped regions may have a dopant concentration no higher than approximately 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>atoms per cubic centimeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> An organic layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is then formed over the surface of the n-type region <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The organic layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be formed using any of the previously described processes. The organic layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be chemically bonded to the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at the surface <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> of the n-type region <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to form an organically passivated photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Because of the organic layer is chemically bonded to the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at the surface <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, dangling bonds in the photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are reduced compared to the photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (if the organic layer would not be formed). The carrier lifetime is increased, and the surface recombination velocity is decreased for photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the electronic efficiency of the electronic device is improved. As used herein, electronic efficiency is defined as 100 percent times the fraction of electrons that pass through or are generated by the electrical device divided the total number of electrons that could be used for electronic current. The divisor in the fraction is substantially a sum of electrons that form electron-hole pairs and electrons that pass through or are generated by the electrical device. Also, the voltage produced by the device under illumination is improved because fewer carriers recombine at the surfaces of the device and more are available for use in device output performance properties. Note that the organic layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> affects an electrical property within the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, even though virtually none of the organic layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> lies within the substrate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and little if any electrons pass through the organic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> If the surface <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> is not properly passivated (e.g., photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>), the photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may have a short carrier lifetime and a relatively high surface recombination velocity because electron-hole pairs are more likely to recombine thereby reducing the electronic current generated by the photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Other geometries are also possible for photovoltaic cells, including structures that have various combinations of p-doped, intrinsic, and n-doped layers arranged in various geometries. Such structures are well known to skilled artisans. The chemically bonded organic layer may be used on one or more surfaces or surface regions of such structures to impart improved electrical properties to the device as a whole formed after such surfaces have been modified using said chemically bonded organic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> includes an illustration of a cross-sectional view of a portion of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. An organic layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is formed over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> using any of the methods previously described. The organic layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may include an alkyl group, an allyl group, an alkoxide, or the like including functional groups listed in Table 1. The physical thickness of the organic layer may be no greater than approximately 10 nm. The organic layer may have an oxide equivalent thickness in a range of approximately 1-5 nm. An oxide equivalent thickness is an equivalent thickness of silicon dioxide that would give the same capacitance if a capacitor structure would be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A gate electrode (control electrode) <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is then formed over the organic layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> using conventional deposition and etching techniques and is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Source/drain regions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be formed within the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> between the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> defines a channel region <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (&ldquo;MOSFET&rdquo;). Therefore, a field-effect transistor can be formed where the organic layer may be part of the gate dielectric for the transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> For the prior example, the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> have a conductivity type opposite that of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The structure in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> can be modified to become a capacitor. The conductivity type of the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be changed to be the same as the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be electrically connected to each other. A combination of the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the substrate form one capacitor electrode, and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is the other capacitor electrode. The organic layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is the capacitor dielectric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> An organic layer may be formed and used with a high-k dielectric material. As used herein, a high-k dielectric material has a dielectric constant of at least approximately 10. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an organic layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> has been formed over the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The organic layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> should be kept relatively thin, such as a monolayer. In some embodiments, the organic layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may comprise organic groups, each of which has no more than approximately three carbon atoms. A high-k gate dielectric material <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may be formed over the organic layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Examples of the high-k material <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> include titanium dioxide, strontium titanate, tantalum pentoxide, or other metal-oxide materials having a dielectric constant of at least approximately 10. The high-k gate dielectric material <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be deposited using conventional techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A gate electrode <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and source/drain regions <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are formed to produce the device illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The gate electrode <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and source/drain regions <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are formed using conventional techniques. The portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> between the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> defines a channel region <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> for the MOSFET. The organic layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may help to reduce dangling bonds and interface states that would otherwise be present if the high-k gate dielectric material <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> would be formed directly if the semiconductor substrate or if a native oxide layer would lie between the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the high-k gate material <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a field-effect transistor can be formed where the organic layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> better allows the use of a high-k gate material <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> for the gate dielectric of the transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The organic layer may be useful in passivating silicon-containing surfaces where oxidation or other adverse reactions could occur. These may be useful in electrical contact and doping applications. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> includes an illustration of a cross-sectional view of a portion of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A gate dielectric layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a gate electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, source/drain regions <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, spacers <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and a patterned insulating layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> have been formed using conventional techniques. The patterned insulating layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> defines openings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that may expose portions of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. If those exposed portions are not protected, a native oxide or other contaminants may reside along the surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> within the openings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and may adversely affect the electrical device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In some instances, very short queue times between processing acts may be used to reduce these adverse effects. However, queue times are difficult to manage in manufacturing operations. If the equipment for a subsequent act is not operational or a backlog of material exists at that equipment, the queue times may not be met and additional processing may be required. Some of this processing may include exposing the substrate to an additional oxide etch, such as a fluorine-containing solution. This additional processing increases processing time, increases the likelihood of mis-processing, or may cause other processing complications, such as an electrical short to an undesired region due to the extra oxide etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> An organic layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be formed along the exposed surfaces of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The organic layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> allows a relatively low temperature passivation layer to be formed along the bottoms of openings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to reduce the likelihood of requiring relatively short queue times. Queue times of approximately four hours or longer may be achieved with the organic passivation layer. In many instances, the queue time limit may extend greater than one day and could potentially be increased to more than approximately one week. This longer queue time allows more processing flexibility at a manufacturing plant and reduces the likelihood of a re-work or other additional processing act that would otherwise not be necessary. In one embodiment, queue times listed above may represent the time between forming the organic passivation layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and its subsequent removal. Unlike photoresist layers, no etching may be performed between forming and completely removing the organic passivation layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with the passivation layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> lying along the bottoms of the contact openings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be placed in a sputtering or other deposition chamber. An initial act may be performed to remove the organic layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> before forming a metal-containing layer. A backsputter act or other equivalent processing act may be used to remove the organic layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> from the bottoms of the contacts. A refractory metal layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which is a metal-containing layer that may include titanium, cobalt, or the like, may be formed along the exposed services of the pattern insulating layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the exposed portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be annealed to form metal-silicide portions <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> along the bottom of the contact openings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A conductive, metal-containing layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may be formed over the refractory metal layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and silicide portions <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The conductive, metal-containing layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may include aluminum, copper, tungsten, or the like. A polishing or etching act may be performed to remove portions of the conductive metal-containing layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and refractory metal layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> overlying the uppermost surface of the pattern insulating layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> to form the interconnects <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that are electrically connected to the source/drain regions <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Although not shown, other electrical connects are made other portions of the electrical device, such as the gate electrode <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. An inorganic passivation layer may be formed over the interconnects and pattern insulating layer to form a substantially completed device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The principles described previously can be extended to situations where dopant diffusion needs to occur from one layer to an underlying region, such as an underlying layer or semiconductor substrate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> includes an illustration of a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> after performing acts in fabricating a bipolar transistor. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> includes a p-type semiconductor bulk material <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, a heavily doped n-type buried layer <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, isolation regions <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, a collector contact region <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, an n-type drift region <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a p-type active base region <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and a p-type inactive base region <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. A patterned insulating layer <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is formed over the substrate and defines an opening <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> where an emitter for the bipolar transistor is to be formed as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Processing acts used in fabricating the device up to this point in time are performed using conventional techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Similar to the contact example previously described, oxidation or other impurities introduced within opening <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may cause adverse effects to the semiconductor device during subsequent processing acts. For example, if an oxide layer formed at the bottom of the opening <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, dopant diffusion from a subsequently formed layer may not occur due to the presence of the oxide layer along the bottom of the opening. Therefore, a queue time may be necessary between forming the opening <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and doping a portion of the active base region <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to form an emitter for the bipolar transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> An organic layer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be formed along an exposed surface of a portion of the active base region <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> at the bottom of the opening <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The active base region <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> typically includes a crystalline semiconductor material that is lightly doped. The organic layer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may help to reduce the likelihood of formation of an oxide layer along the bottom of the opening and may also reduce the likelihood of introducing unwanted impurities or other contaminants into the active base region <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. By using the organic layer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, a relatively longer queue time may be used before forming the emitter for the bipolar transistor. Alternatively, the queue time may be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The organic layer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be removed and a silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> may be formed within the opening <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and over the patterned insulating layer <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> may be in situ doped or may be doped during a subsequent doping act. In one embodiment, the silicon containing-layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> may be substantially undoped. A subsequent implant act may be performed as illustrated by the arrows <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The doping may include an n-type dopant (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or the like). The silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can be a dopant-source layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> An anneal cycle may be performed to diffuse the dopant throughout the silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to make it conductive and also to drive some of the dopant into the active base region <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to form an emitter region <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> for the bipolar transistor as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Portions of the silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that lie outside the opening <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may be removed by polishing, etching, or the like to give the structure a shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. At this point in the process, a bipolar transistor has been formed. Subsequent processing acts may be performed to form other pattern insulating layers, conductors, inorganic passivation layers, or the like in order to form a substantially completed device. These subsequent acts after formation of the connector are conventional. In an alternate embodiment, a doped glass layer could be used as the dopant-source layer instead of the silicon-containing layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Schottky diodes may also be formed using the organic layer. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, an epitaxial, lightly p-type doped silicon containing layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> may be formed over a heavily doped p-type semiconductor bulk material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. An organic layer <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> may be formed as previously described. The organic layer <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is chemically bonded to the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. A patterned insulating layer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and an interconnect <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> are formed over the organic layer <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. If the organic layer <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is relatively thin, the organic layer <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> acts as a &ldquo;leaky&rdquo; capacitor; however it is thick enough to substantially prevent a reaction between the silicon in the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and a metal within the interconnect <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. A backside contact (not shown) is made to the bulk material <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to complete electrical contacts for the Schottky diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment, both contacts for a Schottky contact may be made on the same side of a substrate. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> lightly p-type doped silicon-containing substrate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> includes a heavily p-type doped region. An organic layer <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is formed over the substrate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and doped region <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> using a process as previously described. A patterned insulating layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and interconnects <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. Again, the organic layer <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> acts as a leaky dielectric. The right-hand side interconnect <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> effectively forms an ohmic contact with the substrate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. The left-hand side contact effectively forms a Schottky contact. The combination of the features shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> can be used to as a Schottky diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Silicon-containing metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) devices can be fabricated. The surface of Si (111) can be functionalized with n-alkyl groups using the two-step PCl<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>chlorination/Grignard alkylation procedure previously described above. The bonded aliphatic layer on the surface can serve as the insulating layer of the MIS device. The length of the alkyl chain can be used to vary the thickness of the insulating layer. A 0.04 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>Hg drop can be placed on the functionalized Si surface to form the metal layer of the MIS device. I&mdash;V characteristics of the device may be measured by making an ohmic contact to the back of the sample with Ga/In eutectic and silver epoxy that was in electrical contact with a copper plate. The front contact of the device can be made with a Pt wire immersed in the Hg drop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows I&mdash;V behavior of MIS devices with insulating layers C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>n&plus;1 </subscript></highlight>with n&equals;1, 2, 8. The data show that increasing the thickness of the insulating layer decreases the current density between the semiconductor and the metal and provides improved rectification and other electrical properties of such devices as compared to the devices made without the chemically bonded layer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> compares the I&mdash;V behavior of MIS devices with and without the bonded hydrocarbon insulating layer. A MIS device with C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>as an insulating layer shows the same diodic behavior as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. H-terminated Si (111) surfaces that are immersed either in chlorobenzene or chlorobenzene followed by THF, and therefore, are not functionalized and do not have the insulating layer, display ohmic-like behavior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> After reading this specification, skilled artisans will appreciate that the organic passivation layer used with these various silicon-containing surfaces in electrical devices can be extended to many other applications. The applications presented are to illustrate some of the advantages of embodiments of the present invention and are not meant to limit it. Other applications can be used where electrical properties need to be improved or kept at least to a minimal level. These properties can include carrier lifetime, surface recombination velocities, electron efficiency, contact resistance, resistance of doped regions, or the like. Further, the principles described here in may be extended to other silicon-containing layers throughout electrical devices and may include load resistors, thin film transistors, junction field-effect transistors (JFETs), metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MISFETs) including metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, CMOS amplifiers, tunnel diodes, or the like. The silicon-containing substrates, materials, and layer are not porous, and therefore, can be used in electrical devices. Proper formation and cleaning procedures should be followed to reduce the likelihood of causing reliability problems that are sometimes seen with organic layers that contact electrically active silicon-containing layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Many other electrical structures and devices can be formed.

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the analysis of biological solutions. More particularly, it relates to the detection of particles ranging in size from sub-micron to several microns in solutions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Quantitative measurements of the size and concentration of macromolecules, such as proteins and DNA, is useful for many biological assays as well as studies of colloidal and macromolecular solutions. Traditionally, this has been accomplished through ultracentrifugation, chromatography, and especially, gel electrophoresis. See, Alberts et al. (1994) Molecular Biology of the Cell, Garland Publishing, Inc., NY. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Coulter counters typically consist of two fluid-filled reservoirs of particle-laden solution separated by a membrane and connected by a small aperture or pore in that membrane. Particles in the solution are driven through the pore and in doing so, displace conducting fluid and raise the electrical resistance of the pore. By monitoring the changes in electrical current through the pore as individual particles pass from one reservoir to the other, Coulter counters are able to measure the sizes of particles passing through the pore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> While this method has long been used to characterize solutions of micron-(or greater) size cells, its relative simplicity has led to efforts to employ it to detect sub-micron particles, including viruses. See, Kubitschak (1968) Nature 182:234; Gregg et al. (1965) Biophys. J. 5:393; DeBlois et al. (1970) Rev. Sci. Instrum. 41:909; and DeBlois et al. (1977) J. Colloid Interface Sci. 61:323. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Coulter conduits typically having diameters ranging between approximately 0.015 mm and 0.200 mm, with conduit length-to-diameter ratios L/D between 0.75 and 1.2, have proven useful for a great variety of particles. Resolutions down to particle sizes of 0.6 &mgr;m have been reported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Sun and Crooks have proposed a method for fabricating single pores in a gold membrane. However, use of the gold membrane results in problematic charging effects, which reduce the time resolution of measurements. See, Sun et al. (1999) Langmuir 15:738. Moreover, their device utilizes a pore that runs from one side to the other side of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Koch et al. (1999) J. Micromech. Microeng. 9:159 describes a device having a pore of &tilde;5 micron diameter. The device is capped with a glass sheet which must be adhered to the substrate via high-temperature electrical bonding procedures. Moreover, the fluid access in the Koch device is from the backside of the chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Genetically-modified transmembrane protein pores, suspended in lipid bilayers and molecular-scaled holes in silicon nitride have also been used as engineered nanopores. However, these strategies suffer from difficulties in creating an effective and stable pore or array of pores. See, Howorka et al. (201) Nature Biotechnology 19:636. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Miniaturization of a Coulter counter would allow for other applications such as the characterization of biological cells, e.g., red blood cells, colloids, or even biological molecules. It is desirable that simple apparatus for sensing and characterizing particles be provided which offers increased sensitivity to particle characteristics. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a device that allows the Coulter principle to be applied to the detection and measurement of particles ranging in size from sub-micron to several microns. The device comprises a conduit through which a liquid suspension of particles to be sensed and characterized can be made to pass, wherein the conduit has an effective electrical impedance which is changed with the passage of each particle therethrough; a liquid handling-system for causing the liquid suspension of particles to pass through the conduit; and a measurement system for sensing the change of electrical impedance in the conduit </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the conduit has a cross-sectional area of less than about 1 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and a length of less than about 10 &mgr;m. According to another embodiment, the conduit is formed at least in part by an elastomeric material. The conduit may have be of a variety of shapes and sizes, with either rectangular or circular cross-sections being particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a multi-point measurement system is used to sense the change in electrical impedance of the conduit. Preferably, a four-point electrode system is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The device may be integrated with other microfluidics or nanofluidics systems, including units for delivering the liquid suspension of particles to the liquid handling system; optical detection units; filtration systems; gating systems; particle sorters; dilution systems; and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The device can be fabricated using microfabrication techniques. In one embodiment, the device comprises a substrate into which the reservoirs and conduit have been etched as channels. The device is completed by patterning electrodes in the reservoirs and sealing the channels with an elastomeric cap. In another embodiment, the substrate supports the electrodes. The conduit and the reservoirs are formed in the elastomeric cap. The device is completed by aligning the cap to the electrodes and sealing the cap to the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides methods for sensing and characterizing particles by the Coulter principle. These methods require little sample preparation and thus, are preferred to optical detection techniques. According to such methods, a liquid suspension of particles to be sensed and characterized is passed through a conduit, as described above. The electrical current through the conduit, or the voltage required to maintain the current, is monitored so as to sense the approach of particles to, the presence and characteristics of particles passing through, or the departure of particles from, the conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention, in its preferred embodiments will now be discussed in detail, with reference to the figures listed below.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a device that can sense sub-micron particles in solution in a manner similar to a Coulter counter. More specifically, the present device can detect and measure objects of macromolecular size (e.g., less than 1 &mgr;m). The device is fabricated using conventional microfabrication techniques. Such techniques allow for the precise control of the conduit dimensions which can be easily confirmed using optical and atomic force microscopy. Knowing the exact conduit dimensions allows for the quantitative prediction of the response of the device to particles of various sizes. Devices with conduits having lateral dimensions between 400 nm and 1 &mgr;m have been fabricated and used to detect and measure latex colloidal particles as small as 87 nm in diameter. The ability of the device to detect and measure &tilde;500 nm diameter colloids with a resolution of &plusmn;10 nm has been demonstrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Generally, the device comprises a conduit through which a liquid suspension of particles can be made to pass. The conduit has an effective electrical impedance which is temporarily or permanently changed with the passage of each particle through. The device further comprises a liquid handling-system for causing the liquid suspension of particles to pass through the conduit and a measurement system for sensing the change of electrical impedance in the conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are schematically illustrated, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a device for sensing and characterizing particles. The device of the invention comprises two reservoirs, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, separated by conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, on top of a substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The devices depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> differ in the method by which the conduit is formed. More specifically, in the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is etched into substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is then sealed by an elastomeric cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and reservoirs are formed in the elastomeric cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is than laid on top of substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. For ease in manufacture and use, each of the components of the device are located on the same side of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The Substrate </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Suitable substrate materials are generally selected based upon their compatibility with the conditions present in the particular operation to be performed by the device. Such conditions can include extremes of pH, temperature, ionic concentration, solvent tolerance and application of electric fields. Additionally, substrate materials are also selected for their inertness to critical components of an analysis to be carried out by the system. Useful substrate materials include, e.g., glass, quartz, ceramics, and silicon, as well as polymeric substances, e.g., plastics. Although quartz or glass is preferably used as the substrate, in other embodiments silicon or another inert material of similar physical qualities can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises a material, usually electrically insulating, with a low dielectric constant. Preferably, the substrate will have a dielectric constant of less than about 10. A low dielectric constant is desirable to decrease parasitic capacitance, and thereby increase the achievable time resolution. In the case of conductive or semiconductive substrates, there should be an insulating layer on the substrate. This is important for two reasons. Firstly, since the measurement itself may be compromised by a readily conducting substrate, and secondly since the system may use electrophoretic, electroosmotic, and/or electrokinetic forces to move materials about the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the case of polymeric substrates, the substrate materials may be rigid, semi-rigid, or non-rigid, opaque, semi-opaque, or transparent, depending upon the use for which they are intended. For example, systems which include an optical or visual detection element are generally fabricated, at least in part, from optically transparent materials to allow, or at least, facilitate that detection. Alternatively, optically transparent windows of glass or quartz, e.g., may be incorporated into the device for these types of detection. Optically transparent means that the material allows light of wavelengths ranging from 180 to 1500 nm, usually from 220 to 800 mn, more usually from 250 to 800 nm, to have low transmission losses. Such light transmissive polymeric materials will be characterized by low crystallinity and include polycarbonate, polyethylene terepthalate, polystyrene, polymethylpentene, fluorocarbon copolymers, polyacrylates (including polymethacrylates, and more particularly polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the polymeric materials may have linear or branched backbones, and may be crosslinked or non-crosslinked. Examples of particularly preferred polymeric materials include, e.g., polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), polyurethane, polyvinylchloride (PVC), polystyrene, polysulfone, polycarbonate, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may additionally be provided with access ports and/or reservoirs for introducing the various fluid elements needed for a particular analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, planar substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises a transparent material such as quartz or glass, allowing optical interrogation of the conduit and/or reservoirs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The Cap </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Besides the substrate, the device includes an element which overlays the substrate to enclose and fluidly seal the various channels to form the conduit and reservoirs. Cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may additionally be provided with access ports and/or reservoirs for introducing the various fluid elements needed for a particular analysis as well as outlets for eliminating the various fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be attached to the substrate by a variety of means, including, e.g., thermal bonding, adhesives, or in the case of certain substrate, e.g., quartz, glass, or polymeric substrates, a natural adhesion between the two components. Preferably, cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises an elastomeric material as the elastomeric cap will form a reversible hermetic seal with nearly any smooth planar substrate. An advantage to forming a seal this way is that the elastomeric cap may be peeled up, washed, and re-used. Alternatively, the elastomeric cap may be bonded onto a flat elastomer, quartz, or glass layer, forming a permanent and high-strength bond. This may prove advantageous when higher back pressures are used. See, also Quake et al. (2000) Science 290:1536-1540, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Bonding methods may be used to secure the cap to the substrate, including activating the elastomer surface, for example by plasma exposure, so that the elastomeric cap/substrate will bond when placed in contact. See, e.g., Duffy et al, &ldquo;Rapid Prototyping of Microfluidic Systems in Poly (dimethylsiloxane)&rdquo;, Analytical Chemistry (1998), 70, 4974-4984, and PCT WO 01/18246, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, both cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are oxidized in a (DC- or AC-generated) oxygen plasma to insure the hydrophilicity of the reservoir and conduit and to strengthen the seal to the quartz substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from a wide variety of elastomers. Common elastomeric polymers include polyisoprene, polybutadiene, polychloroprene, polyisobutylene, poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene), the polyurethanes, and silicones. In addition, polymers incorporating materials such as chlorosilanes or methyl-, ethyl-, and phenylsilanes, and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) such as Dow Chemical Corp. Sylgard 182, 184 or 186, or aliphatic urethane diacrylates such as (but not limited to) Ebecryl 270 or Irr 245 from UCB Chemical may also be used. See, e.g., Allcock et al, Contemporary Polymer Chemistry, 2nd Ed., which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The following is a non-exclusive list of materials which may be utilized in connection with the present invention: polyisoprene, polybutadiene, polychloroprene, polyisobutylene, poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene), the polyurethanes, and silicone polymers; or poly(bis(fluoroalkoxy)phosphazene) (PNF, Eypel-F), poly(carborane-siloxanes) (Dexsil), poly(acrylonitrile-butadiene) (nitrile rubber), poly(l-butene), poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene-vinylidene fluoride) copolymers (Kel-F), poly(ethyl vinyl ether), poly(vinylidene fluoride), poly(vinylidene fluoride&mdash;hexafluoropropylene) copolymer (Viton), and elastomeric compositions of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polysulfone, polycarboonate, polymethylmethacrylate(PMMA), and polytertrafluoroethylene (Teflon). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Besides the substrate, the device optionally includes an additional planar cover element (not shown) which overlays cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, i.e, cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is applied to the bottom surface of the cover element and thus, forms an interface between the cover element and the substrate. This planar cover element may be attached to cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by a variety of the means, including, e.g., thermal bonding, adhesives or, in the case of glass, or semi-rigid and non-rigid polymeric substrates, a natural adhesion between the two components. The planar cover element may additionally be provided with access ports and/or reservoirs for introducing the various fluid elements needed for a particular screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary aspect, cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or comprises a PDMS coated glass coverslip. However, the present systems are not limited to this one formulation, type or even this family of polymer; rather, nearly any elastomeric polymer is suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The Reservoirs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Applying the cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> results in the formation of two or more enclosed reservoirs (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) connected by a conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Each of the reservoirs <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is adapted to contain a liquid medium M which comprises a liquid suspension of particles. Preferably, the reservoirs will have a depth of less than about 10 &mgr;m, and more preferably, about 5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Use of a multi-point measurement system allows considerable flexibility in the reservoir design. As such, a wide range of reservoir depths and widths can be used, as permitted by the material and technique used in fabrication. Moreover, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, each of the reservoirs do not have to be the same size or shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Liquid medium M is introduced into the reservoirs through an inlet or access port. Likewise, liquid medium can be transferred from the reservoirs through an outlet port. A wide range of suitable sizes of inlets and outlets are possible, and those of skill in the art are capable of empirically determining the preferred size ranges depending upon the nature of the liquid or the particles to be analyzed. The size of the inlet or the outlet is not a limiting factore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In operation, the reservoirs are filled by capillary action: a drop of solution placed at the edge of the substrate or within the access port is immediately drawn into the reservoirs. Alternatively, the reservoirs can be filled by driving the solution into it using an applied pressure such as can be produced using a pump, such as a syringe pump. Other means for enabling the fluid to move through the device also can be used, for example, but not by way of limitation, devices that force fluid into the device using electric fields. In some cases, it is possible to incorporate a filter into the reservoir so as to keep overly large particles from clogging the conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The Conduit </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As described in more detail below, the conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be formed by a variety of methods. More specifically, according to one embodiment, conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is etched into substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is then sealed by elastomeric cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. See, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be molded into elastomeric cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is then laid on top of substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The dimensions of conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will vary with the size and shape of the particles to be measured. The cross sectional area of the conduit may be circular, square or rectangular, with square being particularly preferred. However, for some applications, it may be desired to use other conduit shapes. For example, for particles having a large aspect ratio, it may be desirable to use a rectangular conduit so that the particles may only transit through the conduit in a limited number of conformations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Generally, conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will have a diameter of from about 0.1 to about 1 &mgr;m. Preferably, the conduit will have a cross section of about 1 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The length of the conduit will generally be greater than its diameter and will be from about 0.1 and about 50 micrometers, and preferably from about 1 to about 10 &mgr;m. Preferably, the ratio of the length of the conduit to the diameter will be about 10:1. Preferably, the volume ratio (i.e., the ratio of the volume of the particle to the volume of the conduit) will be from about 0.0001 to about 0.5; more preferably, from about 0.001 to about 0.2, and most preferably, from about 0.01 to about 0.1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The Measurement System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Generally, a measurement system comprises any means for measuring the change of effective electrical impedance of the conduit with the passage of each particle therethrough. As one of skill in the art will appreciate, a variety of mechanisms are available for measuring impedance, including, but not limited to two-point (i.e., two-electrode), three-point, and four-point measurement systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the measurement system is capable of quantification of uncompensated electrical resistance (extraneous resistance that is in series with the conduit resistance) arising from the fluid leading to the conduit. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the measurement system comprises a four-point measurement system having two inner electrodes and two outer electrodes (i.e., a four-point measurement system) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In one mode, the outer electrodes pass a constant current, and the inner electrodes are used to measure changes in voltage; in another mode, the inner electrodes hold a constant voltage, while the outer electrodes are used to measure changes in current. Preferably, the outer electrodes inject current into the solution whereas the inner electrodes control the voltage applied to the conduit, but pass no current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In multiple conduit systems, it may be desirable to use a three-point measurement system. Each of the units would have an unique set of electrodes (i.e., two individual electrodes) and all of the units would share a common third electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The electrodes generally will be fashioned on the substrate. For example, the electrodes can be made by depositing metal onto the surface of the substrate. The electrodes (and their respective interconnectors to signal generation means and signal detection menas) can comprise any biocompatible substance such as gold, silver, titanium, copper, platinum, iridium, polysilicon, carbon or aluminum. Preferably, the electrodes comprise titanium and platinum or titanium and silver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Typically, the electrodes are configured so as to be symmetric and equidistant from the conduit. However, this is not strictly necessary. Indeed, it may be desirable to fashion an excess number of electrodes onto the substrate. More specifically, when using the cast cap, an excess number of electrodes, e.g., 10 or more or even 12 or more, may be applied to the surface of the substrate. The electrodes are applied in a pattern such that when the cap is applied onto the surface of the substrate, the desired measurement system is formed. Use of an excess number of electrodes, thus, decreases issues associated with aligning the cast cap on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The inner electrodes optimally are situated close to the conduit. In a preferred embodiment having 4&times;200 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>reservoirs, the inner electrodes are about 40 &mgr;m from the conduit. However, when uncompensated resistance arising from the fluid in the reservoir is small (for example, when the reservoirs are very wide and deep compared to the conduit), the placement of the inner electrodes is very flexible. For example, in some circumstances, the inner electrodes can be placed up to about 1 mm from the conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The measurement system can be configured so as to measure change in impedance, resistance or current. A particle&apos;s residence time in the conduit can be measured simultaneously with the measurement of the change in current. Moreover, it may be desirable to monitor the effects of voltage on the current. For example, different voltages could be applied and it would then be determined if the change in current scales linearly with the voltage. This state of some particles might change with applied electric field. As the electric field will vary with voltage, varying the voltage will provide information about the state of the particles. Such information could relate to conformational changes of a large, flexible molecule; changes of the effective charge of a particle due to the applied field affecting the counterion layer around the particle; and the like. In addition, a particle with a dipole moment would become more stringently aligned to a large electric field, which would change the range of peak sizes measured for the particle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The measurement system may utilize either AC or DC current. For the former, the phase as well as the current could be measured. Typically, frequencies of up to at least 40 khz would be scanned. This technique can be useful in differentiating between particles based on charge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Surface Modification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> It may be desirable to modify the surface of the device to reduce or enhance the various driving forces (e.g., electroosmotic, electrokinetic, electrophoretic, and the like) through the conduit or the reservoirs, to reduce or enhance analyte adsorption to the walls of the conduit or the reservoirs, and the like. More specifically, the surface of the conduit can be functionalized; the surface of the reservoirs can be functionalized; or the surfaces of both can be functionalized. In the latter case, the surface of the reservoirs can be modified in the same manner or in a different manner from the functionalization of the conduit. The use of different surface modifications for the conduit and the reservoirs may serve to increase the sensitivity of the device to particular species of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the device can be readily modified by reducing or enhancing analyte adsorption to the walls of the reservoir to allow for the probing of many different molecular interactions. Methods of silane surface chemistry developed in the past twenty years can be applied to the substrate or the conduit, allowing hundreds of different molecules to be grafted onto the device&apos;s surface. The surface can be modified with a coating by using thin-film technology based, for example, on physical vapor deposition, thermal processing, or plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Alternatively, plasma exposure can be used to directly activate or alter the surface and create a coating. For instance, plasma etch procedures can be used to oxidize a polymeric surface (i.e., a polystyrene or polyethylene to expose polar functionalities such as hydroxyls, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, or other reactive moieties). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The coating may comprise an organic thinfilm. Methods for the formation of organic thinfilms include in situ growth from the surface, deposition by physisorption, spin-coating, chemisorption, self-assembly and plasma-initiated polymerization from gas phase. For example, a material such as dextran can serve as a suitable organic thinfilm. Other thinfilms include lipid bilayers; monolayers of polyarginine or polylysine; self-assembled monolayer; and the like. The coating may cover the whole surface of the device or only parts of it, e.g., the conduit or the reservoirs. A variety of techniques for generating patterns of coatings on the surface of a support are well known in the art and include, without limitation, microfluidics printing, microstamping, and microcontact printing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Representative Devices </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A scanning electron micrograph of a representative device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The device was prepared by etching the conduit and reservoirs into a quartz substrate. The cap comprises a PDMS-lined glass coverslip. The device has 3.5 &mgr;m deep reservoirs. The device utilizes a four-point measurement system. The inner electrodes comprise Ti/Pt. The outer electrodes are not visible. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also shows a magnified view of the conduit which has dimensions 5.1&times;1.5&times;1. &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A field emission scanning electron micrograph of another representative device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The device was prepared by molding the conduit and reservoirs into a PDMS cap. The device has a conduit of length 3 &mgr;m and 200 nm which connects the two 5 &mgr;m deep reservoirs. The substrate is a glass coverslip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> An eight-unit device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The device uses a three-point measurement system wherein each unit has unique electrodes and the third electrode is shared between the units. It should also be noted that the device is configured such that each of the units share a common reservoir as well as having a reservoir dedicated to such unit. This configuration, i.e., shared electrodes and/or shared reservoirs is preferentially used in multi-unit devices. Such multi-unit devices will generally comprise a plurality of conduits with the appropriate number of reservoirs, electrodes, etc to permit the sensing and characterizing of particles as they pass through the various conduits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Methods of Fabricating the Present Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Manufacturing of devices may be carried out by any number of microfabrication techniques that are well known in the art. For example, lithographic techniques may be employed in fabricating glass, quartz or silicon substrates, for example, with methods well known in the semiconductor manufacturing industries. Photolithographic masking, plasma or wet etching and other semiconductor processing technologies define microscale elements in and on substrate surfaces. Alternatively, micromachining methods, such as laser drilling, micromilling and the like, may be employed. Similarly, for polymeric substrates, well known manufacturing techniques may also be used. These techniques include injection molding techniques or stamp molding methods where large numbers of substrates may be produced using, e.g., rolling stamps to produce large sheets of microscale substrates, or polymer microcasting techniques where the substrate is polymerized within a microfabricated mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Two exemplary methods of fabricating the present invention are provided herein. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to fabrication by one or the other of these methods. Rather, other suitable methods of fabricating the present devices, including modifying the present methods, are also contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As will be explained, one method involves a series of lithographic processes in which the reservoirs and conduit are etched into planar substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. These methods can easily be used to make a large number of devices on a single chip, thus increasing efficiency through parallelization. This is in comparison to other proposals for the fabrication of small Coulter counters, which rely on difficult and inconsistent techniques that are suitable only in research situations. Conversely, the second method involves the fashioning of conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and reservoirs in elastomeric cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is then contacted with substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The First Exemplary Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> According to the first exemplary method which is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, two reservoirs connected by the conduit are photolithographically (PL) patterned and then etched into the quartz using a CHF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>reactive ion etch (RIE). Electrodes are made by depositing metal in an electron beam evaporator (either titanium and platinum or titanium and silver) on another photolithographic pattern. Finally, substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is sealed on top with elastomeric cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (preferably, a cover slip coated with an elastomer such as oxidized polydimethylsiloxane (silicone)). Each device can be used repeatedly by removing the seal, cleaning, then resealing with a new cap. Note that many different metals can be used for the electrodes, and that the size of the conduit can be greatly decreased by using electron beam lithography (EBL) to initially pattern the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the device is fabricated in multiple stages, with each stage consisting of patterning with photolithography, followed by transferring the pattern onto a substrate using either reactive ion etching (RIE) or metal deposition and lift-off. The first stage is the fabrication of the channel which subsequently becomes the conduit. A line is patterned on the substrate using either photolithography for linewidths&gE;1 &mgr;m, or electron-beam lithography for linewidths between 50 and 500 nm, and then etched to a using a CHF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>RIE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The substrate is cleaned, and then undergoes a second stage of photolithography and RIE to define two reservoirs, preferably, each being 400 &mgr;m wide and 3.5 &mgr;m deep, separated by &tilde;3-10 &mgr;m and connected by the previously-defined channel. The length of the conduit is defined in this second stage by the separation between the two reservoirs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The final stage consists of the lithographic patterning of the electrodes, preferably four electrodes, in the reservoirs, followed by the deposition of 50/250Angstrom Ti/Pt in an electron beam evaporator, and ending with a lift-off of the excess metal. The metal deposition is carried out twice in succession with the sample position &plusmn;45&deg; from normal to the flux of metal to ensure that the electrodes are continuous down both walls of the reservoirs. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a scanning electron micrograph of a completed device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, preferably, an elastomer-coated glass coverslip, is placed atop the substrate before each measurement. After each measurement cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is removed and discarded, and the substrate is cleaned by chemical and ultrasonic methods. Thus, each device can be reused many times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The Second Exemplary Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> According to the second exemplary method, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the reservoirs are molded into elasteromeric cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Preferably, a negative master mold is prepared from a suitable rigid substrate. The master can be used to cast one or preferably, multiple, copies of cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The cap is then contacted with substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that further comprises two or more electrodes to form the microchip Coulter counter. See also, Chou et al. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:11-13 and Xia et al. (1996) Micromolding of Polymers in Capillaries, Applications in Microfabrication. Chem. Mater. 8:1558-1567, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the conduit is first patterned as a thin raised line on a rigid substrate, such as silicon or quartz. The reservoirs are then patterned onto the substrate as raised islands which are connected by the raised conduit to yield the master mold. The patterning steps may be accomplished by a number of conventional silicon processing methods, including but not limited to photolithography, ion-milling, and electron beam lithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> More specifically, photolithography preferably is used to produce masters for devices having conduits with a diameter of about 1 &mgr;m or more. Silicon or quartz will be generally be used as the substrate and patterning will be conducted as known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Electron beam lithography (EBL) with a polystyrene spin-on process is typically used to fashion masters for devices with smaller conduits (e.g., having height and width adjustable from about 450 nm to less than 100 nm). The reservoirs can then be produced using conventional photolithography, preferably using a physically and chemically robust photoresist such as SU-8. Reservoirs having a 5 &mgr;m depth can be readily prepared using this technique. As one of skill in the art will appreciate, the conduit will need to be protected, e.g., through use of an etch mask, during generation of the reservoirs. See, also, Schmid and Michel (2000) Macromolecules 33, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> An elastomeric layer is cast on top of the master mold such that two deeper recesses will be formed for the reservoirs and a narrow recess will be formed for the conduit in the bottom surface of elastomeric layer. More specifically, the recesses will correspond in dimension to the protrusions that were patterned previously. The cast material is allowed to harden and is removed from the master mold which can then be used for additional castings. The cap <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is then laid atop substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a plurality of electrodes thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The elastomeric layer may be cast thick for mechanical stability. In an exemplary embodiment, the elastomeric layer is between about 1 mm and about 5 mm thick, and more preferably approximately about 3 mm thick. A non-exclusive list of ranges of thickness of the elastomer layer in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention is between about 0.1 micron to 10 cm, 1 micron to 5 cm, 10 microns to 2 cm, 100 microns to 10 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Methods of Operating the Present Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Particles to be sensed and characterized are suspended at an appropriate concentration in a suitable liquid medium, e.g., liquid medium M. Liquid medium M generally will have an electrical impedance per unit volume that differs from that of the particles to be characterized. In general any liquid media (either aqueous or nonaqueous) comprising ionic species may be useful in specific applications of the new apparatus. Thus, many of the liquid media (e.g., isotonic saline) used with Coulter apparatus will find direct application. Liquid medium M is exemplified, but not limited to, liquids, such as water, organic solvents, cell cultures, animal or human bodily fluids, solutions comprising particles and/or biological molecules, cellular cytoplasm, cellular extracts, cellular suspensions, solutions of labeled particles or biological molecules, solutions comprising liposomes, encapsulated material, or micelles, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Liquid medium M will further comprise the particles to be measured, which can include live cells, parts of cells such as ribosomes or nuclei, and/or macromolecules such as proteins or nucleic acids. Particles are defined as any small amount of material capable of causing a change in electrical characteristic of the conduit when the medium comprising the particles flows through the conduit. By way of example, but not by way of limitation, particles are any polymer particle, such as polystyrene beads, metal colloids, magnetic particles, dieletric particles, nanocrystals of material, bioparticles such as pores, pollen, cellular occlusions, precipitates, intracellular crystals, and biological molecules, inlcuding polynucleotides, such as DNA and RNA, polysaccharides, polypeptides, proteins, lipids, peptidoglycans, and any other cellular components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The particles may be positively and/or negatively charged or even neutral. As such, a variety of driving mechanisms may be required to deliver the sample to the device. For example, electrophoretic, electrokinetic or electroosmotic forces, or pressure gradients could be used.

When employing Equation 3 to predict resistance changes, an effective value for D is found by equating the cross sectional area of a square conduit with that of a circular conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> If R<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>is the dominant resistance of the measurement circuit, then relative changes in the current I are equal in magnitude to the relative changes in the resistance /&dgr;I/I/&equals;/&dgr;R<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>/R<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>/. Consequently, Equations 2 and 3 can both be directly compared to the measured current changes. This comparison is disallowed if R<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>is similar in magnitude to other series resistances, such as the electrode/fluid interfacial resistance R<highlight><subscript>e/&fnof; </subscript></highlight>or the resistance R<highlight><subscript>u </subscript></highlight>of the reservoir fluid between the inner electrodes and the conduit. By performing a four-point measurement of the conduit current, this resistance R<highlight><subscript>e/&fnof; </subscript></highlight>can be removed from the measurement circuit. R<highlight><subscript>u </subscript></highlight>can be minimized by placing the voltage sensing electrodes close to the conduit (about 50 &mgr;m away on either side) and by designing the reservoir with a cross section much larger than that of the conduit. For a conduit of dimensions 10.5 &mgr;m by 1.04 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>was measured to be 36 M&OHgr; which is in good agreement with the 39 M&OHgr; value predicted by the conduit geometry and the solution resistivity.

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Solutions of negative charged (carboxyl-coated) latex colloids (Interfacial Dynamics, Inc.) having diameters ranging from 87 to 640 nm were measured. All colloids were suspended in a solution of 5&times; concentrated Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer with a resistivity of 390 &OHgr; cm and pH 8.2. To reduce adhesion of the colloids to the reservoir and conduit walls, 0.05% volume to volume (v/v) of the surfactant Tween 20 was added to each solution. The colloidal suspensions were diluted significantly from stock concentrations to avoid jamming of colloids in the conduit; typical final concentrations were 108 particles /ml. The conduit and reservoirs were filled with solution via capillary action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Suspensions of negatively-charged green fluorescent latex colloids (Interfacial Dynamics, Inc.) of diameters 190 nm, 290 nm, and 370 nm in a 50 mM NaCl solution also have been measured using the device of the invention.

Using fluorescence microscopy, it has been confirmed that the particles responded electrophoretically (moving towards the positive electrodes) in response to an applied voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Representative current traces resulting from measuring solutions of 87, 460, 500, 560, and 640 nm are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Representative current traces resulting from measuring solutions of 190 nm, 290 nm, and 370 nm diameter colloids in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The 87 nm data was obtained using an EBL-defined conduit of length 8.3 &mgr;m and cross section 0.16 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The 190 nm data was acquired using a conduit of length 4.1 &mgr;m and cross section 1.47 by 0.72 &mgr;m, while the 370 nm and 290 nm data were acquired with a conduit of length 3.2 &mgr;m and cross section 1.33 by 0.75 &mgr;m. The data for the latex colloids with diameters 460, 500, 560 and 640 nm was obtained using a PL-defined conduit of length 9.5 &mgr;m and cross section 1.2 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. For the data shown, 0.4 V was applied to the conduit. In other runs, the applied voltage was varied between 0.1 and 1 V to test the electrophoretic response of the colloids. Each downward deflection corresponds to a colloid entering the conduit. It was found that the width of the downward current pulses varied approximately as the inverse of the applied voltage, as is expected for simple electrophoretic motion. The data were sampled at 1 kHz. Absolute current values were typically a few nanoamps, with a noise level of &lE;1 pA. The recorded noise primarily originates in the Johnson noise of the conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As previously mentioned, the colloids are driven through the conduit electrophoretically. As the data in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> indicate, the transit times in the device ranged from &tilde;100 ms for the 190 nm particles to &tilde;20 ms for the 370 nm particles. For the solutions, the Debye-H&uuml;ckel length, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>is much less than the particle diameter. The electrophoretic velocity v of a particle with surface charge density &sgr; in applied electric field E. in a solution of viscosity &mgr; is then v&equals;&sgr;E/&mgr;l<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>. The total charge on each colloid &pgr;d<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&sgr; is expected to be in proportion to the manufacturer-supplied number n of ionizable sulfate groups on each particle. Consequently, the value v&pgr;d<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/nE should be constant for colloids of different diameter suspended in solutions of the same electrolytic strength. However, this value, calculated from mean transit time for each colloid size, was found to vary over two orders of magnitude for the colloids used. There may be several causes for this deviation. First, there may be remnant electroosmotic flow in the direction opposite the particles motion that is not entirely removed by the surfactant POP6. These effects might vary from run to run. Second, using fluorescence microscopy, events in which colloids momentarily stick to the conduit walls before passing through have been observed. This appears to be reflected in the wide distribution of transit times found in the data. These problems can be alleviated by applying pressure gradients to drive particle flow and/or by suitable choice of surfactant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a very clear separation between the conduit&apos;s response to the differently sized colloids. The peak widths represent the resolution of this device, about &plusmn;10 nm in diameter for the measured colloids. This precision approaches the intrinsic variation in colloid diameter of 2-4%, as given by the manufacturer. In this run, the maximum throughput was 3 colloids per second, a rate easily achievable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the comparison between the mean pulse heights of the current measurements and the values predicted from Equations 2 and 3. The predicted values have been generated using the measured conduit dimensions and the manufacturer-supplied colloid diameters and have been adjusted for uncompensated resistance. Note that D was found by equating the rectangular cross-sectional area of the conduit with the area of a circle. The data is seen to cross over from the small d/D behavior predicted by Equation 3 to the large d/D behavior predicted by Equation 2. As shown, there is excellent agreement between the measured and calculated values, with the measured error insignificant in comparison to the range of pulse heights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The device can be used for characterization of the size and concentration of small particles, including colloids and large biological molecules, in solution. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows relative changes in baseline current &dgr;I/I vs time for a solution of bacteriophage &lgr;-DNA in 0.1 M KCl, 2 mM Tris (pH 8.4) buffer. The upper trace shows the results of analysis of a buffer solution. The lower trace was obtained using a solution of &lgr;-DNA in buffer. Each downward current pulse represents a single DNA entering the conduit. These peaks are absent when measuring only buffer. The data was obtained using a device having a cast cap with a conduit diameter of &tilde;300 nm and a length of &tilde;4 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Previous work on colloids has shown that, for particles of diameter much smaller than that of the conduit, the ratio of peak height to baseline current is approximately equal to the volume ratio of particle to pore: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&dgr;<highlight><italic>I/I&tilde;V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>Particle</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>/V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>pore </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The volume of a single lambda DNA can be estimated by approximating it as a cylinder with a 2 nm radium (which includes a 1 nm ionic, or Debye, layer) and a height equal to the contour length of the molecule (&tilde;16 &mgr;m). Given the known pore volume and a total current I&equals;15 nA, a decrease in current &dgr;I-30 pA can be expected when a DNA molecule fully inhabits the conduit. This estimate agrees well with the upper range of measured peak heights and suggests that the measured variation in &dgr;I is most likely due to differences in molecular conformation: maximum peak heights arise when an entire molecule inhabits the pore, while smaller peak heights occur when only a portion of a molecule resides within the pore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> By utilizing methods of surface chemistry to attach specific molecules to the device, it can further be used to probe interactions of molecules in solution with those attached to the surface of the device. This can result in measurements of the binding constants between two molecules (such protein-protein, protein-DNA, or enzyme-substrate combinations). In conjunction with other biochemical techniques, these measurements can reveal the nature of the interaction between the two species, which would have implications for the design of drugs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The device also can be modified so as to be capable of separating and collecting species once those species have passed through the sensor region. In this regard, it will be used for to fractionating large biological molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, and it will also be able to fractionate colloids or particles which are attached to proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The devices can be used to discriminate between conformational states of proteins. This is of great potential use in a very wide range of applications across the biosciences and clinical medicine. In particular, there are a host of potential applications in drug discovery and proteomics. The electronic nature of the devices permits rapid and straightforward storage and reporting of the data obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The microchip Coulter counter described herein can be used as a trigger for further measurements or actions downstream. For example, the change in electrical current or voltage, as a particle passes through the conduit can be used as a trigger for subsequent processes, such as the opening or closing of valves to introduce reagents or diluents; the measurement of other properties of the particle or the liquid medium, such as optical properties of the particle or the pH or capacitance of the fluid; and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In addition, the device can be used as a component of a sorting system. The device is used to detect and monitor the sizes of particles as they pass through the conduit. Particles of a selected size (or range of sizes) can be sent along one flow path (i.e., through a first set of channels) for further processing while particles of other sizes can be sent along a different flow path (i.e., through a second set of channels). Similarly, if an optical detection system is integrated with the device, it is possible to separate particles of a selected size and with a specified fluorescence from those having either a different size and/or a different fluorescence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Other applications include use in cell-based assays; genomic analysis, such as DNA sizing, quantification, and amplification; protein analysis, crystallization and purification; biochemical assays; integrated biological sample preparation; and single molecule analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic or Nanofluidic System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The microchip Coulter counter taught herein can readily be adapted to function with microfluidic or nanofluidic sample delivery systems, requires no environmental support apparatus and can readily be combined with other analytic systems to characterize the biological solutions under study even more completely. See J. M. Cooper, Trends Biotechnol. 17, 226 (1999) and D. C. Duffy, J. C. McDonald, O. J. A. Schueller, and G. M. Whitesides, Anal. Chem. 70, 4974 (1998). These papers are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. In this specification, microfluidic shall be taken to mean any channel or system wherein the total volume of biological solution at any one time is not more than 10 microlitres or wherein the cross-sectional dimensions of the sample container in the measurement region are less than or approximately equal to 100 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention also provides for an integrated &ldquo;chip&rdquo; having microfluidic devices for detecting and measuring molecules or particles. In another embodiment, the chip comprises a plurality of devices for sensing and measuring particles and devices for sorting such identified particles (or molecules), wherein the integrated chip identifies and sorts particles (or molecules) of interest. For example, the integrated chip is capable of sorting a mixture of cells, polynucleotides or proteins, or any other particle or biological molecule of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> More specifically, upstream from the Coulter counter may be found one or more of a filtration system, a dilution system, and a means to adjust the driving force of the medium. A gating system for particle analysis or a particle sorter may be included downstream from the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the device described herein may be used in conjunction with the microfabricated elastomeric valve and pump systems described in published U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 20010054778, 20010033796, and 20010029983; U.S. Pat. No. 6,233,048; and PCT publication Nos. WO 01/75176, WO 01/67369, WO 01/32930, and WO 01/01025, each of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The devices of the invention also can be integrated with optical detection devices for further analytical applications, and particularly for multiplexed assays or analysis of heterogeneous mixtures. For example, fluorescence of the various particles could be measured as well as size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. Given these possible variations, as well as others more fully described in the detailed specification attached hereto, the described embodiments should be taken as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention should not be limited to the details given herein but should be defined by the following claims and their full scope of equivalents. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Methods for manipulating carbohydrate processing pathways in cells of interest are provided. Methods are directed at manipulating multiple pathways involved with the sialylation reaction by using recombinant DNA technology and substrate feeding approaches to enable the production of sialylated glycoproteins in cells of interest. These carbohydrate engineering efforts encompass the implementation of new carbohydrate bioassays, the examination of a selection of insect cell lines and the use of bioinformatics to identify gene sequences for critical processing enzymes. The compositions comprise cells of interest producing sialylated glycoproteins. The methods and compositions are useful for heterologous expression of glycoproteins. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to methods and compositions for expressing sialylated glycoproteins in heterologous expression systems, particularly insect cells. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> While heterologous proteins are generally identical at the amino acid level, their post-translationally attached carbohydrate moieties often differ from the carbohydrate moieties found on proteins expressed in their natural host species. Thus, carbohydrate processing is specific and limiting in a wide variety of organisms including insect, yeast, mammalian, and plant cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The baculovirus expression vector has promoted the use of insect cells as hosts for the production of heterologous proteins (Luckow et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Biotech. </italic></highlight>4:564-572, Luckow et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Protein production and processing from baculovirus expression vectors</italic></highlight>). Commercially available cassettes allow rapid generation of recombinant baculovirus vectors containing foreign genes under the control of the strong, polyhedrin promoter. This expression system is often used to produce heterologous secreted and membrane-bound glycoproteins normally of mammalian origin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, post-translational processing events in the secretory apparatus of insect cells yield glycoproteins with covalently-linked oligosaccharide attachments that differ significantly from those produced by mammalian cells. While mammalian cells often generate complex oligosaccharides terminating in sialic acid (SA), insect cells typically produce truncated (paucimannosidic) and hybrid structures terminating in mannose (Man) or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The inability of insect cell lines to generate complex carbohydrates comprising sialic acid significantly limits the wider application of this expression system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The carbohydrate composition of an attached oligosaccharide, especially sialic acid, can affect a glycoprotein&apos;s solubility, structural stability, resistance to protease degradation, biological activity, and in vivo circulation (Goochee et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Bio/technology </italic></highlight>9:1347-1355, Cumming et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>1:115-130, Opdenakker et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>FASEB J. </italic></highlight>7:1330, Rademacher et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Biochem., </italic></highlight>Lis et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Eur. J. Biochem. </italic></highlight>218:1-27). The terminal residues of a carbohydrate are particularly important for therapeutic proteins since the final sugar moiety often controls its in vivo circulatory half-life (Cumming et al (1991) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>1:115-130). Glycoproteins with oligosaccharides terminating in sialic acid typically remain in circulation longer due to the presence of receptors in hepatocytes and macrophages that bind and rapidly remove structures terminating in mannose (Man), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and galactose (Gal), from the bloodstream (Ashwell et al. (1974) <highlight><italic>Giochem. Soc. Symp. </italic></highlight>40:117-124, Goochee et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Bio/technology </italic></highlight>9:1347-1355, Opdenakker et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>FASEB J. </italic></highlight>7:1330). Unfortunately, Man and GlcNAc are the residues most commonly found on the termini of glycoproteins produced by insect cells. The presence of sialic acid can also be important to the structure and function of a glycoprotein since sialic acid is one of the few sugars that is charged at physiological pH. The sialic acid residue is often involved in biological recognition events such as protein targeting, viral infection, cell adhesion, tissue targeting, and tissue organization (Brandley et al. (1986) <highlight><italic>J. of Leukocyte bio. </italic></highlight>40:97-111, Varki et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>FASEB </italic></highlight>11:248-255, Goochee et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Bio/technology </italic></highlight>9:1347-1355, Lopez et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>7:635-651, Opdenakker et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>FASEB J. </italic></highlight>7:1330). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The composition of the attached oligosaccharide for a secreted or membrane-bound glycoprotein is dictated by the structure of the protein and by the post-translational processing events that occur in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of the host cell. Since the secretory processing machinery in mammalian cells differs from that in insect cells, glycoproteins with very different carbohydrate structures are produced by these two host cells (Jarvis et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>212:500-511, Maru et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>271:16294-16299, Altmann et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology </italic></highlight>8:101-114). These differences in carbohydrate structure can have dramatic effects on the in vitro and in vivo properties of the resulting glycoprotein. For example, the in vitro activity of human thyrotropin (hTSH) expressed in insect cells was five times higher than the activity of the same glycoprotein produced from mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Grossman et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Endocrinology </italic></highlight>138:92-100). However, the in vivo activity of the insect cell-derived product was substantially lower due to its rapid clearance from injected rats. The drop in in vivo hTSH activity was linked to the absence of complex-type oligosaccharides terminating in sialic acid in the insect cell product (Grossman et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>EndocrinologyI </italic></highlight>138:92-100). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> N-glycosylation is highly significant to glycoprotein structure and function. In insect and mammalian cells N-glycosylation begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the addition of the oligosaccharide, Glc<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Man<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>GlcNAc<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>onto the asparagine (Asn) residue in the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (Moremen, et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>4:113-125, Varki et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>3(2):97-130, Altmann et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology </italic></highlight>8:101-114). As the glycoprotein passes through the ER and Golgi apparatus, enzymes trim and add different sugars to this N-linked glycan. These carbohydrate modification steps can differ in mammalian and insect hosts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In mammalian cell lines, the initial trimming steps are followed by the enzyme-catalyzed addition of sugars including N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), galactose (Gal), and sialic acid (SA) by the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and as described in Goochee et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Bio/technology </italic></highlight>9:1347-1355. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In insect cells, N-linked glycans attached to heterologous and homologous glycoproteins comprise either high-mannose (Man<highlight><subscript>9-5</subscript></highlight>GlcNAc<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or truncated (paucimannosidic) (Man<highlight><subscript>3-2</subscript></highlight>GlcNAc<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) oligosaccharides; occasionally comprising alpha(1,6)-fucose (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>; Jarvis et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>9:214-223, Kuroda et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>174:418-329, Marz et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Glycoproteins </italic></highlight>543-563, Altmann et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology </italic></highlight>8:101-114). These reports primarily directed to Sf-9 or Sf-21 cells from <highlight><italic>Spodoptera frugiperda, </italic></highlight>indicated that insect cells could trim N-linked oligosaccharides but could not elongate these trimmed structures to produce complex carbohydrates. Reports from other insect cell lines, including <highlight><italic>Tricoplusia ni </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>T. ni; </italic></highlight>High Five&trade;) and <highlight><italic>Estigmena acrea </italic></highlight>(Ea-4), indicated the presence of limited levels of partially elongated hybrid (structures with one terminal Man branch and one branch with terminal Gal, GlcNAc, or another sugar; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and complex (structures with two non-Man termini; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) N-linked oligosaccharides (Oganah et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>14:197-202, Hsu et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:9062-9070). Low levels of GlcNAc transferase I and II (GlcNAc TI and TII), fucosyltransferase, mannosidases I and II, and Gal transferase (Gal T) have been reported in these insect cells; indicating a limited capability for production of these hybrid and complex N-linked oligosaccharides in these cells (Velardo et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>268:17902-17907, Altmann et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology </italic></highlight>8:101-114, van Die et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>6:157-164). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However; most insect cell derived glycoproteins lack complex N-glycans. This absence may be attributed to the presence of the hexosaminidase N-acetylglucosaminidase that cleaves GlcNAc attached to the alpha(1,3) Man branch to generate paucimannosidic oligosaccharides (Licari et al (1993) <highlight><italic>Biotech. Prog. </italic></highlight>9:146-152, Altmann et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>270:17344-17349). Chemicals have been added in an attempt to inhibit this glycosidase activity, but significant levels of paucimannosidic structures remain even in the presence of these inhibitors (Wagner et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>J. Virology </italic></highlight>70:4103-4109). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Manipulating carbohydrate processing in insect cells has been attempted; and in mammalian cells, the expression of sialyltransferases, galactosyltransferases and other enzymes is well established in order to enhance the level of oligosaccharide attachment (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,335). However, in these cases, the presence of the necessary donor nucleotide substrates, most significantly the sialylation nucleotide, CMP-sialic acid, in the proper subcellular compartment has been assumed. Attempts to manipulate carbohydrate processing have been made by expressing single transferases such as N-Acetylglucosamine transferase I (GlcNAc T1), galactose transferase (GAL T), or sialyltransferase (Lee et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>264:13848-13855, Wagner et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>6:165-175, Jarvis et al.

Introduction of a mammalian beta(1, 4)-GalT using viral vectors (Jarvis et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>212:500-511) or stably-transformed cell lines (Hollister et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>8:473-480) indicates that both approaches can enhance the extent of complex glycosylation of foreign glycoproteins expressed in insect cells. GlcNAcT1 co-expression can increase the number of recombinant glycoproteins with oligosaccharides containing GlcNAc on the Man alpha(1,3) branch (Jarvis et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Nature Biotech. </italic></highlight>14:1288-1292, Jarvis et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>212:500-511, Hollister et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>8:473-480; Wagner et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>6:165-175). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> However, the production of complex carbohydrates comprising sialic acid has not been observed in these studies. Sialylation of a single recombinant protein (plasminogen) produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells has been reported (Davidson et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>29:5584-5590), but findings appear to be specific to this glycoprotein. Conversely, many reports indicate the complete absence of any attached sialic acid on glycoproteins from all insect cell lines tested to date (Voss et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Eur. J. Biochem. </italic></highlight>217:913-919, Jarvis et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>212:500-511, Marz et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Glycoproteins </italic></highlight>543-563, Altmann et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology </italic></highlight>8:101-114, Hsu et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:9062-9070). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The reason for this absence of sialylated glycoproteins was initially puzzling since polysialic acid structures were obtained in Drosophila embryos (Roth et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>256:673-675). However, as demonstrated herein, it is now evident that insect cell lines generate very little sialic acid as compared to mammalian CHO cells (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). With very little sialic acid, the insect cells cannot generate the donor nucleotide CMP-sialic acid essential for sialylation. A similar lack or limitation in donor nucleotide substrates may be observed in other eukaryotes as well. Thus, the co-expression of sialyltransferase and other transferases must be accompanied by the intracellular generation of the proper donor nucleotide substrates and the proper acceptor substrates in order for the production of sialylated and other complex glycoproteins in eukaryotes. In addition, sialic acid and CMP-sialic acid are not permeable to cells so these substrates can not be provided directly to the medium of the cultures (Bennett et al. (1981) <highlight><italic>J. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>88:1-15). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The manipulation of post-translational processing is particularly relevant to biotechnology since recombinant DNA products generated in different hosts are usually identical at the amino acid level and differ only in the attached carbohydrate composition (Goochee et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Bio/technology </italic></highlight>9:1347-1355). Engineering carbohydrate pathways is useful to make recombinant DNA technology more versatile and expand the number of hosts that can generate particular glycoforms. This flexibility could ultimately lower biotechnology production costs since host efficiency would be the primary factor dictating which expression system is chosen rather than a host&apos;s capacity to produce a specific glycoform. Furthermore, carbohydrate engineering is useful to tailor a glycoprotein to include specific oligosaccharides that could alter biological activity, structural properties or circulatory targets. Such carbohydrate engineering efforts will provide a greater variety of recombinant glyco-products to the biotechnology industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Glycoproteins containing sialylated oligosaccharides would have improved in vivo circulatory half-lives that could lead to their increased utilization as vaccines and therapeutics. In particular, complex sialylated glycoproteins from insect cells would be more appropriate biological mimics of native mammalian glycoproteins in molecular recognition events in which sialic acid plays a role. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Therefore, manipulating carbohydrate processing pathways in insect and other eukaryotic cells so that the cells produce complex sialylated glycoproteins is useful for enhancing the value of heterologous expression systems and increasing the application of heterologous cell expression products as vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic tools; for increasing the variety of glycosylated products to be generated in heterologous hosts; and for lowering biotechnology production costs, since particular expression systems can be selected based on efficiency of production rather than the capacity to produce particular product glycoforms. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Compositions and methods for producing glycoproteins having sialylated oligosaccharides are provided. The compositions of the invention comprise enzymes involved in carbohydrate processing and production of nucleotide sugars, nucleotide sequences encoding such enzymes, and cells transformed with these nucleotide sequences. The compositions of the invention are useful in methods for producing complex sialylated glycoproteins in cells of interest including, but not limited to, mammalian cells and non-mammalian cells (e.g., insect cells). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The sialylation process involves the post-translational addition of a donor substrate, cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid (CMP-SA) onto a specific acceptor carbohydrate (GalGlcNAcMan-R) via an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by a sialyltransferase in the Golgi apparatus. Since one or more of these three reaction components (i.e., acceptor, donor substrate, and the enzyme sialyltransferase) is limiting or absent in certain cells of interest, methods are provided to enhance the production of the limiting components. Polynucleotide sequences encoding the enzymes used according to the methods of the invention are known or novel bacterial invertebrate, fungal, or mammalian sequences and/or fragments or variants thereof, that are optionally identified using bioinformatics searches. According to one embodiment of the invention, completion of the sialylation reaction is achieved by expressing a sialyltransferase enzyme, or a fragment or variant thereof, in the presence of acceptor and/or donor substrates. The invention also provides an assay for sialylation, wherein the structures and compositions of N-linked oligosaccharides attached to a model secreted glycoprotein, (e.g., transferrin), is elucidated using multidimensional chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Cells of interest that have been recombinantly engineered to produce new forms of sialylated glycoproteins, higher concentrations of sialylated glycoproteins, and/or elevated concentrations of donor substrates (.g., nucleotides sugars) required for sialylation, as well as kits for expression of sialylated glycoproteins are also provided. </paragraph>

The sialylation of N-linked glycans occurs in the Golgi apparatus by the following enzymatic mechanism: CMP-SA&plus;GalGlcNAcMan-R sialyltransferase SAGalGlcNAcMan-R&plus;CMP. The successful execution of this sialylation reaction depends on the presence of three elements: 1) the correct carbohydrate acceptor substrate (designated GalGlcNAcMan-R in the above reaction; where the acceptor substrate is a branched glycan, GalGlcNAcMan is comprised by at least one branch of the glycan, the Gal is a terminal Gal, and R is an N-linked glycan); 2) the proper donor nucleotide sugar, cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid (CMP-SA); and 3) a sialyltransferase enzyme. Each of these reaction components is limiting or missing in insect cells (Hooker et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Monitoring the glycosylation pathway of recombinant human interferon</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>gamma produced by animal cells, </italic></highlight>Hsu et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:9062-9070, Jarvis et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>212:500-511, Jenkins et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Cell Culture Engineering VI, </italic></highlight>Oganah et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>14:197-202). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that where a cell of interest is manipulated according to the methods of the invention such that the cell produces a desired level of the donor substrate CMP-SA, and expresses a desired level of sialyltransferase; any oligosaccharide or monosaccharide, any compound containing an oligosaccharide or monosaccharide, any compatible aglycon (for example Gal-sphingosine), any asparagine (N)-linked glycan, any serine- or threonine-linked (O-linked) glycan, and any lipid containing a monosaccharide or oligosaccharide structure can be a proper acceptor substrate and can be sialylated within the cell of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the methods of the invention may be applied to generate sialylated glycoproteins for which the acceptor substrate is not necessarily limited to the structure GalGlcNAcMan-R, although this structure is particularly recognized as an appropriate acceptor substrate structure for production of N-linked sialylated glycoproteins. Thus, according to the methods of the present invention, the acceptor substrate can be any glycan. Preferably, the acceptor substrate according to the methods of the invention is a branched glycan. Even more preferably, the acceptor substrate according to the methods of the invention is a branched glycan comprising a terminal Gal in at least one branch of the glycan. Yet even more preferably, the acceptor substrate according to the methoids of the invention has the structure GalGlcNAcMan in at least one branch of the glycan and the Gal is a terminal Gal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that engineering the sialylation process into cells of interest according to the methods of the present invention requires the successful manipulation and integration of multiple interacting metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate processing. These pathways include participation of glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, the donor nucleotide sugar (CMP-SA) synthetases, and sialic acid transferases. &ldquo;Carbohydrate processing enzymes&rdquo; of the invention are enzymes involved in any of the glycosyltransfer, glycosidase, CMP-SA synthesis, and sialic acid transfer pathways. Known carbohydrate engineering efforts have generally focused on the expression of transferases (Lee et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>264:13848-13855, Wagner et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>J. Virology </italic></highlight>70:4103-4109, Jarvis et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Nature Biotech. </italic></highlight>14:1288-1292, Hollister et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>8:473-480, Smith et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>265:6225-6234, Grabenhorst et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Eur. J. Biochem. </italic></highlight>232:718-725; U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,335; International patent application publication number WO 98/06835). However, it is recognized in this invention that the mere insertion of one or more transferases into cells of interest does not ensure sialylation, as there are generally insufficient levels of the donor (CMP-SA) and the acceptor substrates, particularly GalGlcNAcMan-R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention permit manipulation of glycoprotein production in cells of interest by enhancing the production of donor nucleotide sugar substrate (CMP-SA) and optionally, by introducing and expressing sialyltransferase and/or acceptor substrates. By &ldquo;cells of interest&rdquo; is intended any cells in which the endogenous CMP-SA levels are not sufficient for the production of a desired level of sialylated glycoprotein in that cell. The cell of interest can be any eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell. Cells of interest include, for example, insect cells, fungal cells, yeast cells, bacterial cells, plant cells, mammalian cells, and the like. Human cells and cell lines are also included in the cells of interest and may be utilized according to the methods of the present invention to, for example, manipulate sialylated glycoproteins in human cells and/or cell lines, such as, for example, kidney, liver, and the like. By &ldquo;desired level&rdquo; is intended that the quantity of a biochemical comprised by the cell of interest is altered subsequent to subjecting the cell to the methods of the invention. In this manner, the invention comprises manipulating levels of CMP-SA and/or sialylated glycoprotein in the cell of interest. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, manipulating levels of CMP-SA and sialylated glycoprotein comprise increasing the levels to above endogenous levels. It is recognized that the increase can be from a non-detectable level to any detectable level; or the increase can be from a detected endogenous level to a higher level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, production of the acceptor substrate is achieved by optionally screening a variety of cell lines for desirable processing enzymes, suppressing unfavorable cleavage reactions that generate truncated carbohydrates, and/or by enhancing expression of desired glycosyltransferase enzymes such as galactose transferase. Methods of enhancing expression of certain carbohydrate processing enzymes, including but not limited to, glycosyltransferases, are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,335 and International patent application publication number WO 98/06835, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, production of the donor substrate, CMP-SA, may be achieved by adding key precursors such as N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucosamine to cell growth media, by enhancing expression of limiting enzymes in CMP-SA production pathway in the cells, or any combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> For purposes of the present invention, by &ldquo;enhancing expression&rdquo; is intended to mean that the translated product of a nucleic acid encoding a desired protein is higher than the endogenous level of that protein in the host cell in which the nucleic acid is expressed. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the biological activity of a desired carbohydrate processing enzyme is increased by enhancing expression of the enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of the invention, by &ldquo;suppressing activity&rdquo; is intended to mean decreasing the biological activity of an enzyme. In this aspect, the invention encompasses reducing the endogenous expression of the enzyme protein, for example, by using antisense and/or ribozyme nucleic acid sequences corresponding to the amino acid sequences of the enzyme; gene knock-out mutagenesis; and/or by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme protein, for example, by using chemical inhibitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;endogenous&rdquo; is intended to mean the type and/or quantity of a biological function or a biochemical composition that is present in a naturally occurring or recombinant cell prior to manipulation of that cell according to the methods of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;heterologous&rdquo; is intended to mean the type and/or quantity of a biological function or a biochemical composition that is not present in a naturally occurring or recombinant cell prior to manipulation of that cell by the methods of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> For purposes the present invention, by &ldquo;a heterologous polypeptide or protein&rdquo; is meant as a polypeptide or protein expressed (i.e. synthesized) in a cell species of interest that is different from the cell species in which the polypeptide or protein is normally expressed (i.e. expressed in nature). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Methods for determining endogenous and heterologous functions and compositions relevant to the invention are provided herein; and otherwise encompass those methods known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Generation of Acceptor Carbohydrate Substrate: GalGlcNAcMan-R </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> According to the methods of the present invention, production of the acceptor substrate glycan GalGlcNAcMan-R, is particularly desirable for the sialylation reaction of N-linked glycoproteins, moreover the terminal Gal is required. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention the cells of interest are manipulated (using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art) to contain this substrate. For example, for insect cells which principally produce truncated carbohydrates terminating in Man or GlcNAc, such cells may routinely be manipulated to produce a significant fraction of complex oligosaccharides terminating in Gal. Three non limiting, non-exclusive approaches that may be routinely applied to produce a significant fraction of complex oligosaccharides terminating in Gal include: (1) developing screening assays to analyze a selection of insect cell lines for the presence of particular carbohydrate processing enzymes; (2) elevating production of Gal-terminated oligosaccharides by expressing specific enzymes relevant to carbohydrate processing pathways; and (3) suppressing carbohydrate processing pathways that produce truncated N-linked glycans which cannot serve as acceptors in downstream glycosyltransferase reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Thus, in one embodiment, to produce GalGlcNAcMan-R acceptor substrates according to the methods of the invention, cell lines of interest are initially, and optionally, screened to identify cell lines with the desired endogenous carbohydrate production for subsequent metabolic manipulations. More particularly, the screening process includes characterizing cell lines for glycosyl transferase activity using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. Furthermore, it is recognized that any screened cell line could generate some paucimannosidic carbohydrates. Accordingly, the screening process also includes using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art to characterize cell lines for particular glycosidase activity leading to production of paucimannosidic structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Thus, in another embodiment, for the production of the acceptor substrates, the invention encompasses utilizing methods described herein or otherwise known in the art to enhance the expression of one or more transferases. Such methods include, but are not limited to, methods that enhance expression of Gal T, GlcNAc-TI and -TII or any combination thereof; for example, as described in International patent application publication number WO 98/06835 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,335. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Thus, in another embodiment, concentrations of acceptor substrates are increased by using methods described herein or otherwise known in the art to suppress the activity of one or more endogenous glycosidases. By way of example, an endogenous glycosidase, the activity of which may be suppressed accoreding to the methods of the invention includes, but is not limited to, the hexosaminidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase (an enzyme that degrades the substrate required for oligosaccharide elongation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Thus, the invention encompasses enhancing metabolic pathways that produce the desired acceptor carbohydrates and/or suppressing those pathways that produce truncated acceptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Characterizing Cell Lines Using Enzyme Screening Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The cell lines of interest produce different N-glycan structures. Thus, such cells can routinely be screened using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art to determine the presence of carbohydrate processing enzymes of interest. In insect cells, for example, different insect cell lines produce very different N-glycan structures (Jarvis et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>212:500-511, Hsu et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:9062-9070, Nishimura et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Bioorg. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>4:91-96). However, only a few cell lines have been characterized, in part due to the lack of efficient screening assays. The present invention provides methods implementing fluorescence energy transfer and Europium fluorescence assays to screen a selection of different cells of interest, such as, for example, insect cell lines for the presence of critical carbohydrate processing enzymes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Analytical bioassays described herein or otherwise known in the art are also provided according to the methods of the present invention to detect the presence of favorable carbohydrate processing enzymes, including, but not limited to, galactosyl transferase (Gal T), GlcNAc transferase I (GlcNAc T I), and sialyltransferase; and to detect undesirable enzymes including, but not limited to, N-acetylglucosaminidase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Where the cells of interest are insect cells, it will be immediately apparent that substantial diversity exists among established insect cell lines due to the range of species and tissues from which these lines were derived. Many of these lines can routinely be infected by the baculovirus, <highlight><italic>Autographa californica </italic></highlight>nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), and used for the production of heterologous proteins. However, only a few cell lines are routinely used for recombinant protein production using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. These cell lines will be immediately apparent by one skilled in the art. It is recognized that any cell line can be screened for specific carbohydrate processing enzymes, and manipulated for the purposes of the present invention. Examples of such cell lines include, but are not limited to, insect cell lines, including but not limited to, <highlight><italic>Spodoptera frugiperda </italic></highlight>(e.g. Sf-9 or Sf-21 cells), <highlight><italic>Trichoplusia ni </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>T. ni</italic></highlight>), and <highlight><italic>Estigmene acrea </italic></highlight>(Ea4). <highlight><italic>Spodoptera frugiperda </italic></highlight>lines (Sf-9 or Sf-2 1) are the most widely used cell lines and a significant amount information is known about the oligosaccharide processing in these cells. <highlight><italic>Trichoplusia ni </italic></highlight>(e.g. High Five&trade; cells; Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif., USA) cells have been shown to secrete high yields of heterologous proteins with attached hybrid and complex N-glycans (Davis et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. </italic></highlight>29:842-846). <highlight><italic>Estigmena acrea </italic></highlight>(Ea-4) have been used to generate hybrid and complex N-linked oligosaccharides terminating in GlcNAc and Gal residues (Oganah et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>14:197-202). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Drosophila Schneider S2 cell lines represent another insect cell line used for the production of heterologous proteins. Though these cells cannot be infected by the AcNPV expression vector, they are used for production of heterologous proteins via an alternative technology known in the art. These cell lines represent other insect cell line candidates whose glycosylation processing characteristics may be modified to include sialylation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In insect cells, paucimannosidic structures are produced by a membrane-bound N-acetylglucosaminidase, which removes terminal GlcNAc residues from the alpha(1,3) arm of the trimannosyl core (Altmann et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>270:17344-17349). This trimannosyl core structure lacks the proper termini required for conversion of side chains to sialylated complex structures; therefore, suppression of the N-acetylglucosaminidase activity can reduce or eliminate the formation of these undesired oligosaccharide structures, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> To reduce the N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in the target insect cell line(s), the invention provides vectors encoding N-acetylglucosaminidase or other glucosaminidase cDNAs in the antisense orientation and/or, vectors encoding ribozymes and/or, vectors containing sequences capable of &ldquo;knocking out&rdquo; the N-acetylglucosaminidase other glucosaminidase genes via homologous recombination. Expression plasmids described herein or otherwise known in the art are constructed using techniques known in the art to produce stably-transformed insect cells that constitutively express the antisense construct and/or ribozyme construct to suppress translation of N-acetylglucosaminidase other glucosaminidases or alternatively, to use homologous recombination techniques known in the art are to &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; the N-acetylglucosaminidase other glucosaminidase genes. Particular sequences to be used in the antisense and/or ribozyme construction are described herein, for example, in Example 4. Techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art may be routinely applied to analyze N-linked oligosaccharide structures and to determine if N-glycan processing is altered and of the number of paucimannosidic structures in these cells is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA or through triple-helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed, for example, in Okano, J. Neurochem. 56: 560 (1991); Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA, or through triple-helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example, in Okano, J., Neurochem. 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Triple helix formation is discussed in, for instance Lee et al., Nucleic Acids Research 6: 3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science 241: 456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science 251: 1360 (1991). The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. For example, the 5&prime; coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the amino terminal portion of N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidases may be used to design antisense RNA oligonucleotides of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidases. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase polypeptides. The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase antisense nucleic acids of the invention are produced intracellularly by transcription from an exogenous sequence. For example, a vector or a portion thereof, is transcribed, producing an antisense nucleic acid (RNA) of the invention. Such a vector would contain a sequence encoding a N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase antisense nucleic acids. Such a vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated, as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Such vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology methods standard in the art. Vectors can be plasmid, viral, or others know in the art, used for replication and expression in insect, yeast, mammalian, and plant cells. Expression of the sequences encoding N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidases, or fragments thereof, can be by any promoter known in the art to act in insect, yeast, mammalian, and plant cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive. Such promoters include, but are not limited to, the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter (Luckow et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Biotech. </italic></highlight>4:564-572, Luckow et al. (1995)), the SV40 early promoter region (Bernoist and Chambon, Nature 29:304-310 (1981), the promoter contained in the 3&prime; long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto et al., Cell 22:787-797 (1980), the herpes thymidine promoter (Wagner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:1441-1445 (1981), the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster, et al., Nature 296:39-42 (1982)), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The antisense nucleic acids of the invention comprise sequences complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase genes. However, absolute complementarity, although preferred, is not required. A sequence &ldquo;complementary to at least a portion of an RNA,&rdquo; referred to herein, means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA, forming a stable duplex; in the case of double stranded N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase antisense nucleic acids, a single strand of the duplex DNA may thus be tested, or triplex formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid Generally, the larger the hybridizing nucleic acid, the more base mismatches with a N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase RNAs it may contain and still form a stable duplex (or triplex as the case may be). One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Oligonucleotides that are complementary to the 5&prime; end of the message, e.g., the 5&prime; untranslated sequence up to and including the AUG initiation codon, should work most efficiently at inhibiting translation. However, sequences complementary to the 3&prime; untranslated sequences of mRNAs have been shown to be effective at inhibiting translation of mRNAs as well. See generally, Wagner, R., 1994, Nature 372:333-335. Thus, oligonucleotides complementary to either the 5&prime;- or 3&prime;-non-translated, non-coding regions of N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidases, could be used in an antisense approach to inhibit translation of endogenous N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase mRNAs. Oligonucleotides complementary to the 5&prime; untranslated region of the mRNA should include the complement of the AUG start codon. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to mRNA coding regions are less efficient inhibitors of translation but could be used in accordance with the invention. Whether designed to hybridize to the 5&prime;-, 3&prime;- or coding region of N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase mRNAs, antisense nucleic acids should be at least six nucleotides in length, and are preferably oligonucleotides ranging from 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length. In specific aspects the oligonucleotide is at least 10 nucleotides, at least 17 nucleotides, at least 25 nucleotides or at least 50 nucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides of the invention can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone, for example, to improve stability of the molecule, hybridization, etc. The oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et al., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:6553-6556; Lemaitre et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84:648-652 (1987); PCT Publication No. WO88/09810, published Dec. 15, 1988), or hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (See, e.g., Krol et al., BioTechniques 6:958-976 (1988)) or intercalating agents. (See, e.g., Zon, Pharm. Res. 5:539-549 (1988)). To this end, the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule, e.g., a peptide, hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, hybridization-triggered cleavage agent, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The antisense oligonucleotide may comprise at least one modified base moiety which is selected from the group including, but not limited to, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xantine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl) uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, beta-D-galactosylqueosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5-methoxycarboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), wybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 3-(3-amino-3-N-2-carboxypropyl) uracil, (acp3)w, and 2,6-diaminopurine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The antisense oligonucleotide may also comprise at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including, but not limited to, arabinose, 2-fluoroarabinose, xylulose, and hexose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified phosphate backbone selected from the group including, but not limited to, a phosphorothioate, a phosphorodithioate, a phosphoramidothioate, a phosphoramidate, a phosphordiamidate, a methylphosphonate, an alkyl phosphotriester, and a formacetal or analog thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide is an alpha-anomeric oligonucleotide. An alpha -anomeric oligonucleotide forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual beta-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gautier et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:6625-6641 (1987)). The oligonucleotide is a 2-0-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:6131-6148 (1987)), or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue et al., FEBS Lett. 215:327-330 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotides of the invention may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art, e.g. by use of an automated DNA synthesizer (such as are commercially available from Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, etc.). As examples, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. (Nucl. Acids Res. 16:3209 (1988)), methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore glass polymer supports (Sarin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:7448-7451 (1988)), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> While antisense nucleotides complementary to the N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase coding region sequences could be used, those complementary to the transcribed untranslated region are most preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Potential N-acetylglucosaminidase or other glucosaminidase activity suppressors according to the invention also include catalytic RNA, or a ribozyme (See, e.g., PCT International Publication WO 90/11364, published Oct. 4, 1990; Sarver et al, Science 247:1222-1225 (1990). While ribozymes that cleave mRNA at site specific recognition sequences can be used to destroy N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase mRNAs, the use of hammerhead ribozymes is preferred. Hammerhead ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the target mRNA. The sole requirement is that the target mRNA have the following sequence of two bases: 5&prime;-UG-3&prime;. The construction and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff and Gerlach, Nature 334:585-591 (1988). Preferably, the ribozyme is engineered so that the cleavage recognition site is located near the 5&prime; end of the N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase mRNAs; i.e., to increase efficiency and minimize the intracellular accumulation of non-functional mRNA transcripts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As in the antisense approach, the ribozymes of the invention can be composed of modified oligonucleotides (e.g. for improved stability, targeting, etc.) and should be delivered to cells which express N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidases in vivo. DNA constructs encoding the ribozyme may be introduced into the cell in the same manner as described above for the introduction of antisense encoding DNA. A preferred method of delivery involves using a DNA construct &ldquo;encoding&rdquo; the ribozyme under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, such as, for example, pol III or pol II promoter, so that transfected cells will produce sufficient quantities of the ribozyme to destroy endogenous N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase messages and inhibit translation. Since ribozymes unlike antisense molecules, are catalytic, a lower intracellular concentration is required for efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Endogenous gene expression can also be reduced by inactivating or &ldquo;knocking out&rdquo; the N-acetylglucosaminidase and/or other glucosaminidase gene and/or its promoter using targeted homologous recombination. (E.g., see Smithies et al., Nature 317:230-234 (1985); Thomas &amp; Capecchi, Cell 51:503-512 (1987); Thompson et al., Cell 5:313-321 (1989); each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). For example, a mutant, non-functional polynucleotide of the invention, or a completely unrelated DNA sequence (such as for example, a sialic acid synthetase) flanked by DNA homologous to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence (either the coding regions or regulatory regions of the gene) can be used, with or without a selectable marker and/or a negative selectable marker, to transfect cells that express polypeptides of the invention in vivo. In another embodiment, techniques known in the art are used to generate knockouts in cells that contain, but do not express the gene of interest. Insertion of the DNA construct, via targeted homologous recombination, results in inactivation of the targeted gene. Such approaches are particularly suited in research and agricultural fields where modifications to embryonic stem cells can be used to generate animal offspring with an inactive targeted gene (e.g., see Thomas &amp; Capecchi 1987 and Thompson 1989, supra). The contents of each of the documents recited in this paragraph is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The use of chemical inhibitors is also within the scope of the present invention, in addition to, or as an alternative to, the antisense approach, and/or the ribozyme approach, and/or the gene &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; approach, as means for suppressing glucosaminidase activity in insect cell cultures. Chemical inhibitors that may be used to suppress glucosaminidase activity include, but are not limited to, 2-acetamido- 1,2,5-trideoxy-1,5 amino-D-glucitol can limit the N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in insect cells (Legler et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>1080:80-95, Wagner et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>J. Virology </italic></highlight>70:4103-4109). In addition, a number of other N-acetylglucosaminidase inhibitors may also be used according to the present invention, including, but not limited to, nagastatin (with a K<highlight><subscript>I </subscript></highlight>value in the 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>range) and GlcNAc-oxime (K<highlight><subscript>I </subscript></highlight>in 0.45-22 mM) which are commercially, publicly, or otherwise available for the purposes of the present invention (Nishimura et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Bioorg. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>4:91-96, Aoyagi et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>J. Antibiotics </italic></highlight>45:1404-1408). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The chemical inhibitors mentioned above do not distinguish between lysosomal N-acetylglucosaminidase and the target membrane-bound N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in the secretory compartment. Thus, a more specific inhibitor, based on the substrate structure, is provided to serve not merely as a competitive inhibitor, but also as an affinity labeling reagent. The chemical structure for two possible chemical compounds with specificity for inhibiting membrane-bound glucosaminidase one or both of which may be used according to the present invention, are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. Subsequent to expression and purification of the N-acetylglucosaminidase, the effectiveness of these inhibitors may be tested and compared in in vitro and/or in vivo trials using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. As above, these chemical inhibitors are then used in addition to, or as an alternative to, antisense suppression, ribozyme suppression, and/or gene knock-out mutagenesis, of glucosaminidase activity in insect cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> It is recognized that the suppression of glucosaminidase activity alone may not lead to production of the desired acceptor carbohydrate, if the enzymes responsible for generating structures terminating in Gal are lacking in particular cell lines. Thus, according to the methods of the present invention, Gal T activity in insect cells can be increased significantly by using techniques described described herein or otherwise known in the art to express a heterologous gene using a baculovirus construct containing nucleic acid sequences encoding Gal T or a fragment or variant thereof, or by stably transforming the cells with a gene coding for Gal T or a fragment or variant thereof. If N-glycan analysis indicates that lower than a desired level of the acceptor substrates are present even following glucosaminidase suppression, techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art may be applied to express glycosyltransferase enzymes as needed in insect cells to produce a larger fraction of the desired acceptor structures. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> depicts that the overexpression of various glycosyltransferases leads to greater production of acceptor substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the expression of glycosyltransferases will serve to limit generation of paucimannosidic structures by generating unacceptable glucosaminidase substrates terminating in Gal, or by competing against the glucosaminidase reaction (Wagner et al., <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>6:165-175 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Thus, the invention comprises expression of glycosyltransferases combined with, or as an alternative to, suppression of N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in selected insect cell lines to produce desired quantities of carbohydrates containing the correct Gal (G) acceptor substrate for sialylation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> illustrates, without limitation, three examples of acceptor N-glycan structures that comprise the terminal Gal acceptor residue required for subsequent sialylation. Other desired carbohydrates structures with a branch terminating Gal are also possible and are encompassed by the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Baculovirus expression vectors containing the coding sequence for GlcNAc-TI and -TII, and Gal T or fragments or variants thereof, and stable transfectants overexpressing GlcNAc-TI and GlcNAc-TII, and Gal T, or fragments or variants thereof are known, can be routinely generated using techniques known in the art, and are commercially, publicly, or otherwise available for the purposes of this invention. (See Jarvis et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Nature Biotech. </italic></highlight>14:1288-1292; Hollister et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>8: 473-480; the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference). In addition, stable transfectants expressing GlcNAc-TI and GlcNAc-TII can be routinely generated using techniques known in the art, if overexpression proves desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Production and Delivery of the Donor Substrate: CMP-Sialic Acid (CMP-SA) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> For production of the donor substrate, CMP-SA, the invention provides methods and compositions comprising expression of limiting enzymes in the CMP-SA production pathway; in addition, or as an alternative to, the feeding of precursor substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> To produce sialylated N-linked glycoproteins, the donor substrate, CMP-sialic acid (CMP-SA), must be synthesized. The structure of CMP-SA is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. CMP-SA can be enzymatically synthesized from glucose or other simple sugars, glutamine, and nucleotides in mammalian cells and <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>using the metabolic pathways shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and as described in Ferwerda et al. (1983) <highlight><italic>Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>216:87-92; Mahmoudian et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Enzyme and Microbial Technology </italic></highlight>20:393-400; Schachter et al. (1973) <highlight><italic>Metabolic Conjugation and Metabolic Hydrolysis </italic></highlight>(New York Academic Press) 2-135. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In some mammalian tissues and cell lines, the production and delivery of CMP-SA limits the sialylation capacity of these cells (Gu et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Improvement of the interferon</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>gamma sialylation in Chinese hamster ovary cell culture by feeding N</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>acetylmannosamine</italic></highlight>). This problem is likely to be amplified in insect cells since negligible sialic acid levels are detected in <highlight><italic>Trichoplusia ni </italic></highlight>insect cells as compared to levels in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) mammalian cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). Furthermore, negligible CMP-SA was observed in Sf-9 and Ea-4 insect cells when compared to CHO cells (Hooker et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Monitoring the Glycosylation Pathway of Recombinant Human Interferon</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Gamma Produced by Animal Cells, </italic></highlight>European Workshop on Animal Cell Engineering, Costa Brava, Spain; and Jenkins (1998) <highlight><italic>Restructuring the Carbohydrates of Recombinant Glycoproteins, </italic></highlight>Cell Culture Engineering VI, San Diego, Calif.). These findings are relevant in light of the previously published observation that polysialic acid can be detected in Drosophila embryos (Roth et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>256:673-675) and the observation of sialylated glycoproteins produced by other insect cells (Davidson et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>29:5584-5590). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Production of sialic acid (SA), more specifically N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc), from the precursor substrate ManNAc can proceed through three alternative pathways shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The principal pathway for the production of SA in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and other bacteria utilizes the phosphoenylpyruvate (PEP) and ManNAc to produce sialic acids in the presence of sialic acid synthetase (Vann et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>7:697-701). A second pathway, observed in bacteria and mammals, involves the reversible conversion by aldolase (also named N-acetylneuraminate lyase) of ManNAc and pyruvate to sialic acid (Schachter et al. (1973) <highlight><italic>Metabolic Conjugation and metabolic Hydrolysis </italic></highlight>(New York Academic Press) 2-135, Lilley et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Prot. Expr. and Pur. </italic></highlight>3:434-440). The aldolation reaction equilibrates toward ManNAc but can be manipulated to favor the production of sialic acid by the addition of excess ManNAc or pyruvate in vitro (Mahmoudian et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Enzyme and Microbial Technology </italic></highlight>20:393-400). The third pathway, observed only in mammalian tissue, begins with the ATP driven phosphorylation of ManNAc, and is followed by the enzymatic conversion of phosphorylated ManNAc to a phosphorylated form of sialic acid, from which the phosphate is removed in a subsequent step (van Rinsum et al. (1983) <highlight><italic>Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>210:21-28, Schachter et al. (1973) <highlight><italic>Metabolic Conjugation and metabolic Hydrolysis </italic></highlight>(New York Academic Press) 2-135). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the invention, to overcome intracellular limitations of CMP-SA in mammalian cells, feeding of alternative precursor substrates may be applied to eliminate or reduce the need to produce CMP-SA from simple sugars (see Example 6). Since CMP-SA and its direct precursor, SA, are not permeable to cell membranes (Bennetts et al. (1981) <highlight><italic>J. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>88:1-15), these substrates cannot be added to the culture medium for uptake by the cell. However, other precursors, including N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), glucosamine, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) when added to the culture medium are absorbed into mammalian cells (see Example 6). See, for example, Gu et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Improvement of the interferon</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>gamma sialylation in Chinese hamster ovary cell culture by feeding N</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>acetylmannosamine, </italic></highlight>Zanghi et al.

(1981) <highlight><italic>J. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>88:1-15. The substrates are then enzymatically converted to CMP-SA and incorporated into homologous and heterologous glycoproteins (Gu et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Improvement of the interferon</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>gamma sialylation in Chinese hamster ovary cell culture by feeding N</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>acetylmannosamine, </italic></highlight>Ferwerda et al.

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> To be incorporated into oligosaccharides, sialic acid and cytidine triphosphate (CTP) must be converted to CMP-SA by the enzyme, CMP-sialic acid (CMP-SA) synthetase (Schachter et al. (1973) <highlight><italic>Metabolic Conjugation and metabolic Hydrolysis </italic></highlight>(New York Academic Press) 2-135): </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> This enzyme has been cloned and sequenced from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and used for the in vitro production of CMP-SA, as described in Zapata et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>264:14769-14774, Kittleman et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>44:59-67, Ichikawa et al.

<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In eukaryotes, the activated sugar nucleotide, CMP-SA, must be transported into the Golgi lumen for sialylation to proceed (Deutscher et al. (1984) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>39:295-299). Transport through the trans-Golgi membrane is facilitated by the CMP-SA transporter protein, which was identified by complementation cloning into sialylation deficient CHO cells (Eckhardt et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>93:7572-7576). This mammalian gene has also been cloned and expressed in a functional form in the heterologous host, <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>(Bernisone et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:12616-12619). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In addition to feeding of external precursor substrates such as ManNAc, GlcNAc, or glucosamine to increase CMP-SA levels, a supplementary approach in which CMP-SA transporter genes are introduced and expressed using routine recombinant DNA techniques may also be employed according to the methods of the present invention. These techniques are optionally combined with ManNAc, GlcNAc, or glucosamine feeding strategies described above, to maximize CMP-SA production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Conversion of GlcNAc or Glucosamine to ManNAc </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Also according to the methods of the present invention, where the utilization of GlcNAc or glucosamine is preferred and ManNAc is not generated naturally in insect cells, ManNAc can be produced chemically using sodium hydroxide (Mahmoudian et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Enzyme and Microbial Technology </italic></highlight>20:393-400). Alternatively, the enzymes that convert these substrates to ManNAc or fragments or variants of these enzymes, can be expressed in insect cells using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. The production of ManNAc from GlcNAc and glucosamine proceeds through the metabolic pathway shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Two approaches are provided to accomplish this conversion: (a) direct epimerization of GlcNAc; or (b) conversion of GlcNAc or glucosamine to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), and then ManNAc. According to one embodiment of the invention, approach (a) is achieved using the gene encoding a GlcNAc-2-epimerase isolated from pig kidney, or fragments or variants thereof, to directly convert GlcNAc to ManNAc (See Maru et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>271:16294-16299; the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference). Additionally, the sequence for a homologue of this enzyme can be routinely obtained from bioinformatics databases, and cloned into baculovirus vectors, or stably integrated into insect cells using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, approach (b) requires insertion of the gene to convert UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc. Engineering the production of UDP-GlcNAc from glucosamine or GlcNAc is likely not required since most insect cells comprise metabolic pathways to synthesize UDP-GlcNAc; as indicated by the presence of GlcNAc-containing oligosaccharides. According to one embodiment of the invention, the gene encoding a rat bifunctional enzyme coding for conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc and ManNAc to ManNAc-6-P, or fragments or variants thereof is used to engineer the production of UDP-GlcNAc using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art (Stasche et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:24319-24324, the contents which are herein incorporated by reference). In a specific embodiment, the segment of this enzyme responsible for conversion of UDP-GlNAc to ManNAc may be expressed independently in insect cells using techniques known in the art to produce ManNAc rather than ManNAc-6-P. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Conversion of ManNAc to SA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Once ManNAc is generated, it is converted to SA according to the methods of the invention. There are three possible metabolic pathways for the conversion of ManNAc to SA in bacteria and mammals, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. Negligible SA levels have previously been observed in insect cells (in the absence of exogenous supplementation of ManNAc to the culture media). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The conversion of ManNAc and PEP to SA using sialic acid synthetase is the predominant pathway for SA production in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>(Vann et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>7:697-701). The <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>sialic acid (SA) synthetase gene NeuB (SEQ ID NO:7 and 8) has been cloned and sequenced and is commercially, publicly, and/or otherwise available for the purposes of the present invention. Additionally, as disclosed herein, the human sialic acid synthetase gene has also been cloned (cDNA clone HA5AA37), sequenced, and deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (&ldquo;ATCC&rdquo;) on Feb. 24, 2000 and was given the ATCC Deposit Number PTA-1410. (The ATCC is located at 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA. ATCC deposits were made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for purposes of patent procedure.) Thus, for enhancing expression of SA synthetase according to certain embodiments of the invention, the nucleic acid compositions encoding a SA synthetase such as, for example, an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and/or human sialic acid synthetase and/or a fragment or variant thereof, may be inserted into a host expression vector or into the host genome using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. According to the methods of the invention, the production of SA can also be achieved from ManNAc and pyruvate using an aldolase, such as, for example, bacterial aldolase (Mahmoudian et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Enzyme and Microbial Technology </italic></highlight>20:393-400), or a human aldolase (as described herein) or fragment or variant thereof. The human aldolase gene has been cloned (cDNA clone HDPAK85), sequenced, and deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (&ldquo;ATCC&rdquo;) on Feb. 24, 2000 and was given the ATCC Deposit Number PTA-1410. Thus, the aldolase enzyme is considered as an alternative for converting ManNAc to SA. For enhancing expression of aldolase, the aldolase sequences can be amplified directly from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and human DNA using primers and PCR amplification as described in Mahmoudian et al. (Mahmoudian et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Enzyme and Microbial Technology </italic></highlight>20:393-400); the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference) and herein, and using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art to enhance expression of aldolase, or a fragment or variant thereof. Since the aldolase reaction is reversible, high levels of added ManNAc and pyruvate, may be used according to the methods of the invention to drive this reversible reaction in the direction of the product SA (Mahmoudian et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Enzyme and Microbial Technology </italic></highlight>20:393-400). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In addition to the pathways which convert ManNAc to SA present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, an exclusively eukaryotic pathway may also employed according to the methods of the invention to convert ManNAc to SA through the phosphate intermediates ManNAc-6-phosphate and SA-9-phosphate. It is recognized that the mammalian enzymes (synthetase and phosphatase) responsible for converting ManNAc to SA through phosphate intermediates can be utilized for engineering this eukaryotic pathway into insect cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Conversion of SA to CMP-SA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The methods of the invention also encompass the use of CMP-SA synthetase to enzymatically converts SA to CMP-SA (see, e.g., the reaction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>). However, insect cells, such as, for example, Sf9 insect cells, have negligible endogenous CMP-SA synthetase activity. Evidence of limited CMP-SA synthetase in insect cells is also demonstrated by increased SA levels found following substrate feeding and genetic manipulation without a concomitant increase in CMP-SA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Thus, specific embodiments of the invention provide methods for enhancing the expression of CMP-SA synthetase, and/or fragments or variants thereof. Bacterial CMP-SA synthetase has been cloned and sequenced as described in Zapata et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>264:14769-14774; the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. Additionally, as described herein the gene encoding human CMP-SA synthetase has also been cloned (cDNA clone HWLLM34), sequenced and deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (&ldquo;ATCC&rdquo;) on Feb. 24, 2000 and was given the ATCC Deposit Number PTA-1410. Thus, in specific embodiments, the methods of the present invention provide for enhancing expression of bacterial or human CMP-SA synthetase or fragments, or variants thereof, in cells of interest, such as, for example, in insect cells, using techniques described herein, or otherwise known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Golgi Transport of CMP-SA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> CMP-SA must be delivered into the Golgi apparatus in order for sialylation to occur, and this transport process depends on the presence of the CMP-SA transporter protein (Deutscher et al. (1984) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>39:295-299). To determine if CMP-SA synthesized in insect cells is efficiently transported into the proper cellular compartment, insect cell vesicles are prepared and transport of CMP-SA is measured as described in (Bernisone et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:12616-12619) and/or using techniques otherwise known in the art. Where the native enzymatic transport is lower than desired, a transporter enzyme is cloned and expressed in insect cells using the known mammalian gene sequence (as described in Bernisone et al.

Corresponding sequences are available from bioinformatics databases for the purposes of this invention. Localization of the protein to the Golgi is evaluated using an antibody generated against the heterologous protein using techniques known in the art in concert with commercially available fluorescent probes that identify the Golgi apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Expression cloning of multiple transcripts (for example, transcripts encoding CMP-SA pathway enzymes, glycosyl transferases, and ribozymes or anti-sense RNAs to suppress hexosaminidases) in a single cell line using techniques known in the art may be required to bring about the desired sialylation reactions and/or to optimize these reactions. Alternatively, co-infection of cells with multiple viruses using techniques known in the art can also be used to simultaneously produce multiple recombinant transcripts. In addition, plasmids that incorporate multiple foreign genes including some under the control of the early promoter IE1 are commercially, publicly, or otherwise available for the purposes of the invention, and can be used to create baculovirus constructs. The present invention encompasses using any of these techniques. The invention also encompasses using the above mentioned types of vectors to enable expression of desired carbohydrate processing enzymes in baculovirus infected insect cells prior to production of a heterologous glycoprotein of interest under control of the very late polyhedrin promoter. In this manner, once the desired polypeptide is synthesized essential N-glycan processing enzymes can facilitate N-glycan processing once the glycoprotein of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, genes for some of the enzymes may be incorporated directly into the insect cell genome using vectors known in the art, such as, for example, vectors similar to those described in (Jarvis et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>8:950-955, Jarvis et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Baculovirus Expr. Protocols </italic></highlight>ed. 39:187-202). Genomic integration eliminates the need to infect the cells with a large number of viral constructs. These constructs for genomic integration contain one or more early viral promoters, including AcMNPV IE1 and 39K, which provide constitutive expression in transfected insect cells (Jarvis et al. (1990) Bio/Technology 8:950-955). In addition, a sequential transformation strategy may routinely be developed for producing stable transformants that constitutively express up to four different heterologous genes simultaneously. These vectors and transformation techniques are provided for the purposes of this invention. In this manner, incorporation of plasmids containing heterologous genes into the insect cell genome combined with baculovirus infection integrates the metabolic pathways leading to efficient acceptor and donor substrate production in insect cells. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The final step in the generation of sialylated glycoproteins or glycolipids in mammalian cells is the enzymatic transfer of sialic acid from the donor substrate, CMP-SA, onto an acceptor substrate in the Golgi apparatus; a reaction which is catalyzed by sialyltransferase. The sialic acid (SA) residues occurring in N-linked glycoproteins are alpha-linked to the 3 or 6 position of the GalGlcNAc sugars (Tsuji, S. (1996) <highlight><italic>J. Biochem. </italic></highlight>120:1-13). The SA alpha2-3GalGlcNAc linkage is found in heterologous glycoproteins expressed by CHO and human cells and the SA alpha2-6GalGlcNAc linkage is found in many human glycoproteins (Goochee et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Bio/technology </italic></highlight>9:1347-1355). The alpha2-3- and/or alpha2-6-sialyltransferase genes along with a number of other sialyltransferase genes have been cloned, sequenced and expressed as active heterologous proteins as described in Lee et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>264:13848-13855, Ichikawa et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>202:215-238, Tsuji, S. (1996) <highlight><italic>J. Biochem. </italic></highlight>120:1-13; U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,335, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. Any one or more of these genes, as well as fragments, and/or variants thereof may be introduced and expressed in cells of interest using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art, and may be used according to the methods of the present invention to enhance the enzymatic transfer of sialic acid from the donor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> For generating N-Linked sialylated glycoproteins in insect cells, once the donor (CMP-SA) and acceptor (GalGlcNAc-R) substrates are produced as described above, the methods of the invention further comprise expression of a sialyltransferase or fragment or variant thereof, in the cells. The completion of the sialylation reaction can be verified by elucidating the N-glycan structures attached to a desired glycoprotein using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. It is recognized that evaluation of N-glycans attachments may also suggest additional metabolic engineering strategies that can further enhance the level of sialylation in insect cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> It is observed that unmodified <highlight><italic>T. ni </italic></highlight>insect cell lysates failed to generate any sialylated compounds when incubated with the substrate, LacMU, and the nucleotide sugar, CMP-SA. Thus, it is concluded that these cells comprise negligible native sialyltransferase activity. However, infection of insect cells with a baculovirus containing alpha2,3 sialyltransferase provided significant enzymatic conversion of LacMU and CMP-SA to sialylLacMU. For the purposes of the invention, heterologous sialyltransferase can be expressed using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art either by co-infection with a virus coding for sialyltransferase, or fragment, or variant thereof, or by using stable transfectants expressing the enzyme. In addition to the 2,3 sialyltransferase baculovirus constructs, baculovirus vectors comprising sequences coding for alpha2,6 sialyltransferase and/or fragments or variants thereof as well as stably transformed insect cells stably expressing both gal T and sialyltransferase are commercially, or publicly available, and/or may routinely be generated using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. Evaluation of sialyltransferase activity is determined using the FRET or HPLC assays described herein and/or using other assays known in the art. Localization of the sialyltransferase to the Golgi is accomplished using anti-sialyltransferase antibodies commercially, publicly, or otherwise available for the purpose of this invention in concert with Golgi specific marker proteins. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> By a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95% &ldquo;identical&rdquo; to a reference nucleotide sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid is identical to the reference sequence except that the nucleotide sequence may include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence encoding the described polypeptide. In other words, to obtain a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. The query sequence may be an entire sequence, such as, for example, that shown of SEQ ID NO:1, the ORF (open reading frame), or any fragment as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is at least, for example, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence of the presence invention can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. (1990) 6:237-245.) In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both DNA sequences. An RNA sequence can be compared by converting U&apos;s to T&apos;s. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are: Matrix&equals;Unitary, k-tuple&equals;4, Mismatch Penalty&equals;1, Joining Penalty&equals;30, Randomization Group Length&equals;0, Cutoff Score&equals;1, Gap Penalty&equals;5, Gap Size Penalty 0.05, Window Size&equals;500 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5&prime; or 3&prime; deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for 5&prime; and 3&prime; truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5&prime; or 3&prime; ends, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5&prime; and 3&prime; of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only bases outside the 5&prime; and 3&prime; bases of the subject sequence, as displayed by the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5&prime; end of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched/alignment of the first 10 bases at 5&prime; end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases at the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends not matched/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5&prime; or 3&prime; of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only bases 5&prime; and 3&prime; of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% &ldquo;identical&rdquo; to a query amino acid sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a query amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted, deleted (indels) or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least, for example, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for example, the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:2 or to the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA contained in a deposited clone can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237-245(1990)). In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are either both nucleotide sequences or both amino acid sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix&equals;PAM 0, k-tuple&equals;2, Mismatch Penalty&equals;1, Joining Penalty&equals;20, Randomization Group Length&equals;0, Cutoff Score&equals;1, Window Size&equals;sequence length, Gap Penalty&equals;5, Gap Size Penalty&equals;0.05, Window Size&equals;500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C-termini not matched/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, to determine the percent homology of two amino acid sequences, or of two nucleic acids, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of one protein or nucleic acid for optimal alignment with the other protein or nucleic acid). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in one sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the other sequence, then the molecules are homologous at that position. As used herein, amino acid or nucleic acid &ldquo;homology&rdquo; is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid &ldquo;identity&rdquo;. The percent homology between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., percent homology equals the number of identical positions/total number of positions times 100). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Variants of above described sequences include a substantially homologous protein encoded by the same genetic locus in an organism, i.e., an allelic variant. Variants also encompass proteins derived from other genetic loci in an organism, but having substantial homology to the proteins of FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, or otherwise described herein. Variants also include proteins substantially homologous to the protein but derived from another organism, i.e., an ortholog. Variants also include proteins that are substantially homologous to the proteins that are produced by chemical synthesis. Variants also include proteins that are substantially homologous to the proteins that are produced by recombinant methods. As used herein, two proteins (or a region of the proteins) are substantially homologous when the amino acid sequences are at least about 55-60%, typically at least about 70-75%, more typically at least about 80-85%, and most typically at least about 90-95% or more homologous. A substantially homologous amino acid sequence, according to the present invention, will be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence hybridizing to the nucleic acid sequence, or portion thereof, of the sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27, 28</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or otherwise described herein under stringent conditions as more fully described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Orthologs, homologs, and allelic variants that are encompassed by the invention and that may be used according to the methods of the invention can be identified using methods well known in the art. These variants comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein that is at least about 55%, typically at least about 70-75%, more typically at least about 80-85%, and most typically at least about 90-95% or more homologous to the nucleotide sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27, 29</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, or otherwise described herein, or a fragment of this sequence. Such nucleic acid molecules can readily be identified as being able to hybridize under stringent conditions, to the nucleotide sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27, 29</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, or complementary sequence thereto, or otherwise described herein, or a fragment of the sequence. It is understood that stringent hybridization does not indicate substantial homology where it is due to general homology, such as poly A sequences, or sequences common to all or most proteins in an organism or class of proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The invention also encompasses polypeptides having a lower degree of identity but having sufficient similarity so as to perform one or more of the same functions performed by the enzyme polypeptides described herein. Similarity is determined by conserved amino acid substitution. Such substitutions are those that substitute a given amino acid in a polypeptide by another amino acid of like characteristics (see Table 1). Conservative substitutions are likely to be phenotypically silent. Typically seen as conservative substitutions are the replacements, one for another, among the aliphatic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu, and Ile; interchange of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr, exchange of the acidic residues Asp and Glu, substitution between the amide residues Asn and Gln, exchange of the basic residues Lys and Arg and replacements among the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr. Guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent are found in Bowie et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>247:1306-1310 (1990).

Preferred computer program methods to determine identify and similarity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, GCG program package (Devereux, J. (1984) <highlight><italic>Nuc. Acids Res. </italic></highlight>12(1):387), BLASTP, BLASTN, FASTA (Atschul, S. F. (1990) <highlight><italic>J. Molec. Biol. </italic></highlight>215:403). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> A variant polypeptide can differ in amino acid sequence by one or more substitutions, deletions, insertions, inversions, fusions, and truncations or a combination of any of these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Variant polypeptides can be fully functional or can lack function in one or more activities. Thus, in the present case, variations can affect the function, for example, of one or more of the modules, domains, or functional subregions of the enzyme polypeptides of the invention. Preferably, polypeptide variants and fragments have the described activities routinely assayed via bio assays described herein or otherwise known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Fully functional variants typically contain only conservative variation or variation in non-critical residues or in non-critical regions. Functional variants can also contain substitution of similar amino acids, which result in no change or an insignificant change in function. Alternatively, such substitutions may positively or negatively affect function to some degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Non-functional variants typically contain one or more non-conservative amino acid substitutions, deletions, insertions, inversions, or truncation or a substitution, insertion, inversion, or deletion in a critical residue or critical region. As indicated, variants can be naturally-occurring or can be made by recombinant means or chemical synthesis to provide useful and novel characteristics for the polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Amino acids that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>244:1081-1085 (1989)). The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity. Sites that are critical can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling (Smith et al., <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>224:899-904 (1992); de Vos et al. <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>255:306-312 (1992)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The invention further encompasses variant polynucleotides, and fragments thereof, that differ from the nucleotide sequence, such as, for example, those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27, 29</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or otherwise described herein, due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same protein as that encoded by the nucleotide sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27, 29</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or otherwise described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides nucleic acid molecules encoding the variant polypeptides described herein. Such polynucleotides may be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus), homologs (different locus), and orthologs (different organism), or may be constructed by recombinant DNA methods or by chemical synthesis. Such non-naturally occurring variants may be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. Accordingly, as discussed above, the variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Polynucleotides&rdquo; or &ldquo;nucleic acids&rdquo; that may be used according to the methods of the invention also include those polynucleotides capable of hybridizing, under stringent hybridization conditions, to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:1, the complement thereof, or a cDNA within the deposited plasmids. As used herein, the term &ldquo;hybridizes under stringent conditions&rdquo; is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences encoding a receptor at least 55% homologous to each other typically remain hybridized to each other. The conditions can be such that sequences at least about 65%, at least about 70%, or at least about 75% or more homologous to each other typically remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. One example of stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization in 6&times;sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45 degrees C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2&times;SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50-65 degrees C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Also contemplated for use according to the methods of the invention are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to a polynucleotide disclosed herein under lower stringency hybridization conditions. Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration (lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency); salt conditions, or temperature. For example, lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 degree C. in a solution comprising 6&times;SSPE (20&times;SSPE&equals;3M NaCl; 0.2M NaH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>; 0.02M EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 30% formamide, 100 ug/ml salmon sperm blocking DNA; followed by washes at 50 degree C. with 1&times;SSPE, 0.1% SDS. In addition, to achieve even lower stringency, washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations (e.g. 5&times;SSC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and/or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt&apos;s reagent, BLOTTO, heparin, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above, due to problems with compatibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA&plus; sequences (such as any 3&prime; terminal polyA&plus; tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing), or to a complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in the definition of &ldquo;polynucleotide,&rdquo; since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly (A) stretch or the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo-dT as a primer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes under stringent conditions to a sequence disclosed herein, or the complement thereof, such as, for example, the sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27, 29</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a &ldquo;naturally-occurring&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature (e.g., encodes a natural protein). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The present invention also encompasses recombinant vectors, which include the isolated nucleic acid molecules and polynucleotides that may be used according to the methods of the present invention, and to host cells containing the recombinant vectors and/or nucleic acid molecules, as well as to methods of making such vectors and host cells and for using them for production of glycosylation enzyme by recombinant techniques. Polypeptides produced by such methods are also provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The invention encompasses utilizing vectors for the maintenance (cloning vectors) or vectors for expression (expression vectors) of the desired polynucleotides encoding the carbohydrate processing of the invention, or those encoding proteins to be sialylated by the methods of the invention and/or by expression of the proteins the cells of the invention. The vectors can function in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells or in both (shuttle vectors). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, one or more of the polynucleotide sequences used according to the methods of the invention are inserted into commercially, publicly, or otherwise available baculovirus expression vectors for enhanced expression of the corresponding enzyme. In another non-exclusive embodiment, one ore more of the polynucleotides used according to the methods of the invention are inserted into other viral vectors or for generation of stable insect cell lines. Techniques known in the art, such as, for example, HPAEC and HPLC techniques, may be routinely used to evaluate the enzymatic activity of these enzymes from both eukaryotic and bacterial sources to determine which source is best for generating SA in insect cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Generally, expression vectors contain cis-acting regulatory regions that are operably linked in the vector to the polynucleotide to be expressed, or other relevant polynucleotides such that transcription of the polynucleotides is allowed in a host cell. The polynucleotides can be introduced into the host cell with a separate polynucleotide capable of affecting transcription. Thus, the second polynucleotide may provide a trans-acting factor interacting with the cis-regulatory control region to allow transcription of the polynucleotides from the vector. Alternatively, a trans-acting factor may be supplied by the host cell. Finally, a trans-acting factor can be produced from the vector itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> It is understood, however, that in some embodiments, transcription of the polynucleotides can occur in a cell-free system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The regulatory sequence to which the polynucleotides described herein can be operably linked include, for example, promoters for directing mRNA transcription. These promoters include, but are not limited to, baculovirus promoters including, but not limited to, 1E0, 1E1, 1E2, 39k, 35k, egt, ME53, ORF 142, PE38, p6.9, capsid, gp64 polyhedrin, p10, basic and core; and insect cell promoters including, but not limited to, Drosophila actin, metallothionine, and the like. Where the host cell is not an insect cell, such promoters include, but are not limited to, the left promoter from bacteriophage lambda, the lac, TRP, and TAC promoters from <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, promoters from Actinomycetes, including Nocardia, and Streptomyces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Promoters may be isolated, if they have not already been isolated, by standard promoter identification and trapping methods known in the art, see, for example, in Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>2nd. ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> It would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the choice of promoter would depend upon the choice of host cell. Similarly, the choice of host cell will depend upon the use of the host cell. Accordingly, host cells can be used for simply amplifying, but not expressing, the nucleic acid. However, host cells can also be used to produce desirable amounts of the desired polypeptide. In this embodiment, the host cell is simply used to express the protein per se. For example, amounts of the protein could be produced that enable its purification and subsequent use, for example, in a cell free system. In this case, the promoter is compatible with the host cell. Host cells can be chosen from virtually any of the known host cells that are manipulated by the methods of the invention to produce the desired glycosylation patterns. These could include mammalian, bacterial, yeast, filamentous fungi, or plant cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In addition to control regions that promote transcription, expression vectors may also include regions that modulate transcription, such as repressor binding sites and enhancers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In addition to containing sites for transcription initiation and control, expression vectors can also contain sequences necessary for transcription termination and, in the transcribed region a ribosome binding site for translation. Other regulatory control elements for expression include initiation and termination codons as well as polyadenylation signals. The person of ordinary skill in the art would be aware of the numerous regulatory sequences that are useful in expression vectors. Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Sambrook et al., cited above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Depending on the choice of a host cell, a variety of expression vectors can be used to express the polynucleotide. Such vectors include chromosomal, episomal, and particularly virus-derived vectors, for example, AcMNPV, OpMNPV, BmNPV, HzMNPV, and RoMNPV. Vectors may also be derived from combinations of these sources such as those derived from plasmid and bacteriophage genetic elements, e.g. cosmids and phagemids. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are described in Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. </italic></highlight>2nd. ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The regulatory sequence may provide constitutive expression in one or more host cells or may provide for inducible expression in one or more cell types such as by temperature, nutrient additive, or exogenous factor such as a hormone or other ligand. A variety of vectors providing for constitutive and inducible expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides can be inserted into the vector nucleic acid using techniques known in the art. Generally, the DNA sequence that will ultimately be expressed is joined to an expression vector by cleaving the DNA sequence and the expression vector with one or more restriction enzymes and then ligating the fragments together. Procedures for restriction enzyme digestion and ligation are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Specific expression vectors are described herein for the purposes of the invention; for example, AcMNPV. Other expression vectors listed herein are not intended to be limiting, and are merely provided by way of example. The person of ordinary skill in the art would be aware of other vectors suitable for maintenance, propagation, or expression of the polynucleotides described herein. These are found for example in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. </italic></highlight>2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. Any cell type or expression system can be used for the purposes of the invention including but not limited to, for example, baculovirus systems (O&apos;Riley et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Baculovirus Expression Vectors, </italic></highlight>W. H. Freeman and Company, New York 1992) and Drosophila-derived systems (Johansen et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Genes Dev </italic></highlight>3(6):882-889). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The invention also encompasses vectors in which the nucleic acid sequences described herein are cloned into the vector in reverse orientation, but operably linked to a regulatory sequence that permits transcription of antisense RNA. Thus, an antisense transcript can be produced to all, or to a portion, of the polynucleotide sequences described herein, including both coding and non-coding regions. Expression of this antisense RNA is subject to each of the parameters described above in relation to expression of the sense RNA (regulatory sequences, constitutive or inducible expression, tissue-specific expression). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The recombinant host cells are prepared by introducing the vector constructs described herein into the cells by techniques readily available to the person of ordinary skill in the art. These include, but are not limited to, calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection, lipofection, and other techniques such as those found in Sambrook, et al. (<highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. </italic></highlight>2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Where secretion of the polypeptide is desired, appropriate secretion signals known in the art are incorporated into the vector using techniques known in the art. The signal sequence can be endogenous to the polypeptides or heterologous to these polypeptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Where the polypeptide is not secreted into the medium, the desired protein can be isolated from the host cell by techniques known in the art, such as, for example, standard disruption procedures, including freeze thaw, sonication, mechanical disruption, use of lysing agents and the like. The polypeptide can then be recovered and purified by well-known purification methods including, but not limited to, ammonium sulfate precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cationic exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic-interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, lectin chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, for suppressing activity of endogenous N-acetylglucosaminidase, the invention encompasses utilizing the sequences deduced from the fragment identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, and described in Example 4. More particularly, in this aspect, the invention comprises utilization of the glucosaminidase nucleotide sequences which are produced by using primers, such as, for example, those primer combinations described in Example 4. These nucleotide sequences may be used in the construction and expression of anti-sense RNA, ribozymes, or homologous recombination (gene &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo;) constructs, using methods readily available to those skilled in the art, to reduce or eliminate in vivo glucosaminidase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Cell lines produced by the methods of the invention can be tested by expressing a model recombinant glycoprotein in such cell lines and assessing the N-glycans attached therein using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. The assessment can be done, for example, by 3-dimensional HPLC techniques. In the Examples of the invention, human transferrin is used as a model target glycoprotein, since this glycoprotein is sialylated in humans and extensive oligosaccharide structural information for the protein is available (Montreuil et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Glycoproteins II </italic></highlight>Ed. 203-242). In this manner, cell lines with superior processing characteristics are identified. Such a cell line can then be evaluated for its growth rate, product yields, and capacity to grow in suspension culture (Lindsay et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Biotech. and Bioeng. </italic></highlight>39:614-618, Reuveny et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Ann. NY Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>665:320, Reuveny et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>38:619-623, Reuveny et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Biotechnol. Bioeng. </italic></highlight>42:235-239). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The invention encompasses expressing heterologous proteins in the cells of the invention and/or according to the methods of the invention for any purpose benefiting from such expression. Such a purpose includes, but is not limited to, increasing the in vivo circulatory half life of a protein; producing a desired quantity of the protein; increasing the biological function of the protein including, but not limited to, enzyme activity, receptor activity, binding capacity, antigenicity, therapeutic property, capacity as a vaccine or a diagnostic tool, and the like. Such proteins may be naturally occurring chemically synthesized or recombinant proteins. Examples of proteins that benefit from the heterologous expression of the invention include, but are not limited to, transferrin, plasminogen, Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-ATPase, thyrotropin, tissue plasminogen activator, erythropoietin, interleukins, and interferons. Other examples of such proteins include, but are not limited to, those described in International patent application publication number WO 98/06835, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, proteins that benefit from the heterologous expression of the invention are mammalian proteins. In this aspect, mammals include but are not limited to, cats, dogs, rats, mice, cows, pigs, non-human primates, and humans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> It is recognized that the heterologous expression of the invention not only encompasses proteins that are sialylated in their native source; but also those that are not sialylated as such, and benefit from the expression in the cells of and/or according to the methods of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> It is recognized that proteins that are not sialylated in their native source, can be altered by known genetic engineering methods so that the heterologous expression of the protein according to the invention will result in sialylation of the protein. Such methods include, but are not limited to, the genetic engineering methods described herein. In this aspect, it is further recognized that altering the proteins could encompass engineering into the protein targeting signals to ensure targeting of the proteins to the ER and Golgi apparatus for sialylation, where such signals are needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> It is also recognized that the cells of the invention contain proteins, which are not sialylated prior to manipulation of the cells according to the methods of the invention, but are sialylated subsequent to the manipulation. In this manner, the invention also encompasses proteins that have amino acid sequences that are endogenous to the cells of the invention, but are sialylated as a result manipulation of the cells according to the methods of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> It is recognized that the analysis of the N-glycans produced according to the methods of the invention may suggest additional strategies to further enhance the sialylation of glycoproteins in insect cells. If the production of Gal containing carbohydrate acceptor structures is low relative to those containing GlcNAc, then the levels of Gal transferase expression are increased by integrating multiple copies of this gene into the insect cell genome or by expressing Gal T under a stronger promoter using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. Additionally, or alternatively, substrate feeding strategies are used to enhance the levels of UDP-Gal for this carbohydrate processing reaction. In contrast, if the fraction of carbohydrate structures terminating in Gal is high and the fraction with terminal SA is low, then sialyltransferase or CMP-SA production is enhanced. Examination of sialyltransferase activity using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art, such as, for example, FRET or HPLC and CMP-SA levels using HPAEC, is used to determine which step is the metabolic limiting step to sialylation. These metabolic limitations are overcome by increasing expression of specific enzymes or by altering substrate feeding strategies or a combination thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">ASSAYS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Having generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood by reference to the following assays and examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended as limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Analytical bioassays are implemented to evaluate enzymatic activities in the N-glycosylation pathway of insect cells. In order to screen a larger selection of insect cells for particular oligosaccharide processing enzymes, bioassays in which multiple samples can be analyzed simultaneously are advantageous. Consequently, bioassays based on fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) and time-resolved fluorometry of europium (Eu) are designed to screen native and recombinant insect cell lines for carbohydrate processing enzymes in a format that can handle multiple samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Fluorescence assays are especially useful in detecting limiting steps in carbohydrate processing due to their sensitivity and specificity. FRET and Eu assays detect enzymatic activities at levels as low as 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;14 </superscript></highlight>M, which is greater than the sensitivity obtained with <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I. In addition, the use of substrates modified with fluorophores enables the measurement of one specific enzyme activity in an insect cell lysate, and multiple samples can be analyzed simultaneously in a microtiter plate configuration used in an appropriate fluorometer. With these assays, insect cell lines are rapidly screened for the presence of processing enzymes including Gal, GlcNAc, and sialic acid transferases to identify limiting enzymes in N-glycosylation in native and recombinant cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Fluorescence Energy Transfer (FRET) Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Glycosyl transferase activity assays are based on the principle of fluorescence energy transfer (FRET), which has been used to study glycopeptide conformation (Rice et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>30:6646-6655) and to develop endo-type glycosidase assays (Lee et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>230:31-36). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Gal T Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> The fluorescent compound, UDP-Gal-6-Naph, synthesized by consecutive reactions of galactose oxidase (generating 6-oxo compound) and reductive amination with naphthylamine, is found to be effective as a substrate for Gal transferase. When UDP-Gal-6-Naph is reacted with an acceptor carrying a dansyl group (Dans-AE-GlcNAc) in the presence of Gal-T, a product is created that can transfer energy (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). While irradiation of the naphthyl group in UDP-Gal-6-Naph at 260-290 nm (&ldquo;ex&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) results in the usual emission at 320-370 nm (&ldquo;em&rdquo; dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>), irradiation of the product at these same low wavelengths results in energy transfer to the dansyl group and emission at 500-560 nm (&ldquo;em&rdquo; solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Assay sensitivity is as great as the fluorometer allows (pico- to femtomol range) and exceeds that of radioisotopes. In addition, multiple samples can be monitored simultaneously in the fluorometer, allowing a number of cell lines to be evaluated rapidly for Gal T activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Sialyltransferase Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> A sialyltransferase assay is designed using similar FRET technology described in the above example for Gal T. The 3-carbon tail (exocyclic chain) of sialic acid (in particular, its glycoside) can be readily oxidized with mild periodate to yield an aldehyde (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). This intermediate is reductively aminated to generate a fluorescently tagged sialic acid (after removal of its aglycon), which is then modified to form a fluorescently modified CMP-sialic acid (See also Lee et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>216:358-364, Brossamer et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymol. </italic></highlight>247:153-177). The acceptor substrate is modified as described above to include the dansyl group. Then the FRET approach is used to measure either alpha(2,3) or alpha(2,6) sialyltransferase activity since these enzymes should utilize the modified CMP-SA as donor substrate to generate a product with altered fluorescent emission characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The choice of the fluorescent donor and acceptor pair can be flexible. The above examples are given using naphthyl-dansyl pairs, but other fluorescent combinations may be even more sensitive (Wu et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>250:260-262). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Europium (Eu<highlight><superscript>&plus;)</superscript></highlight>) Fluorescence Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> An example of the use of Eu<highlight><superscript>&plus;3 </superscript></highlight>fluorescence for the evaluation of Gal T activity is provided herein in the N-linked oligosaccharides from insect cells. The same techniques are used to develop enzymatic assay for transferases such as GlcNAc T1 and glycosidases such as N-acetylglucosaminidase. Further enhancements in sensitivity are obtained with the advent of the super-sensitive Eu-chelator, BHHT (4,4&prime;-bis(1&Prime;, 1&Prime;, I&Prime;, 2&Prime;,2&Prime;,3&Prime;,3&prime;-heptatluro-4&Prime;,6&Prime;-hexanedione-6&prime;-yl)-chlorosulfo-o--terphenyl) (Yuan et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>70:596-601), which allows detection down to the lower fmol range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> GlcNac-TI Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> A new GlcNAc-TI assay, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, utilizes a synthetic 6-aminohexyl glycoside of the trimannosyl N-glycan core structure labeled with DTPA (Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) and complexed with Eu<highlight><superscript>&plus;3</superscript></highlight>. This substrate is then incubated with insect cell lysates or positive controls containing GlcNAc T1 and UDP-GlcNAc. Addition of chemical inhibitors are used to minimize background N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. After the reaction, an excess of Crocus lectin CVL (Misaki et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:25455-25461), which specifically binds the trimannosyl core, is added. The amount of the lectin required to bind all the trimannosyl glycoside (and hence all the Eu<highlight><superscript>&plus;3 </superscript></highlight>label) in the absence of any GlcNAc binding is predetermined. The reacted mixture is then filtered through a 10,000 molecular weight cut off (MWCO) microfuge ultrafiltration cup. The glycoside modified with GlcNAc does not bind CVL and appears in the filtrate. Measurement of the Eu<highlight><superscript>&plus;3 </superscript></highlight>fluorescence in the filtrate reflects the level of GlcNAc T1 activity in the culture lysates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> N-Acetylglucosaminidase Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> An assay for N-acetylglucosaminidase activity is developed using a different lectin, GS-II, which is specific for GlcNAc. The substrate is prepared by modification of the same trimannosyl core glycoside described above using in vitro purified GlcNAc T1, which results in addition of a GlcNAc_beta(1-2) residue to the Man_alpha(1-3) residue. Following incubation with insect cell lysates, enzymatic hydrolysis by N-acetylglucosaminidase removes GlcNAc from the substrate resulting in the tri-mannosyl core product. The product is not susceptible to lectin binding and thus escapes into the filtrate. Evaluation of Eu<highlight><superscript>&plus;3 </superscript></highlight>fluorescence in the filtrate provides a measure of the N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. Alternatively, enhanced binding of the Eu-bound trimannosyl core to the Crocus lectin described above can be used as another assay for N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Characterization of N-Linked Oligosaccharides from Insect Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Carbohydrate structure elucidation of the N-glycans of a recombinant glycoprotein, IgG, purified from <highlight><italic>Trichoplusia ni </italic></highlight>(High Five&trade; cells; Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif., USA) has been undertaken (Davis et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. </italic></highlight>29:842-846; Hsu et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:9062-9070). The recombinant glycoprotein, immunoglobulin G (IgG), was purified from both intracellular and extracellular (secreted) sources and all the attached N-glycans determined using three dimensional HPLC techniques. The composition of these structures provided insights into the carbohydrate processing pathways present in insect cells and allowed a comparison of intracellular and secreted N-glycan structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><italic>Trichoplusia ni </italic></highlight>cells grown in serum free medium in suspension culture were infected with a baculovirus vector encoding a murine IgG (Summers et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>A manual of methods for baculovirus vectors and insect cells culture procedures</italic></highlight>). IgG includes an N-linked oligosaccharide attachment on each of the two heavy chains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Heterologous IgG was purified from the culture supernatant and soluble cell lysates using a Protein A-Sepharose column. N-linked oligosaccharides were isolated following protease digestion of IgG and treatment with glycoamidase A to release the N-glycans. Oligosaccharides were then derivatized with 2-aminopyridine (PA) at the reducing ends to provide fluorogenic properties for detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Three-dimensional HPLC analysis, was performed to elucidate the N-linked oligosaccharide structures attached to the heavy chain of IgG (Tomiya et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>171:73-90, Takahashi et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Handbook of Endoglycosidases and Glycoamidases Ed. </italic></highlight>199-332). This technique separates oligosaccharides by three successive HPLC steps and enables the identification of structures by comparison of elution conditions with those of known standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> A DEAE column was used to separate oligosaccharides on the basis of carbohydrate acidity (first dimension). None of the oligosaccharides retained on this column were found to include sialic acid. Treatment of the acidic fractions with neuraminidase from <highlight><italic>Arthrobacter ureafaciens </italic></highlight>(known to cleave all known sialic acid linkages) failed to release any sialic acid, and ODS-chromatography of the fractions revealed several minor components different from all known sialylated oligosaccharides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The second dimension used reverse phase HPLC with an ODS-silica column to fractionate the labeled oligosaccharides according to carbohydrate structure. Supernatant (S) and lysate (L) IgGs oligosaccharides were separated into 6 and 10 fractions, respectively, labeled A-L in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Separation in the third and final dimension was accomplished using an amide column to isolate oligosaccharides on the basis of molecular size. Peak B from the ODS column was separated into two separate oligosaccharide fractions, and peak H was separated into three separate oligosaccharide fractions on the amide-column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> After oligosaccharide purification, structures of unknown oligosaccharides were determined by comparing their positions on the 3-dimensional map with the positions of over 450 known oligosaccharides. Co-elution of an unknown sample with a known PA-oligosaccharide on the ODS and amide-silica columns was used to confirm the identity of an oligosaccharide. Digestion by glycosidases with specific cleavage sites (alpha-L-fucosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and alpha-mannosidase) followed by reseparation provided further confirmation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> All the oligosaccharides in the culture medium and cell lysates matched known carbohydrates except for oligosaccharide G. The structure of oligosaccharide G was elucidated by treatment of the N-glycan with alpha-<highlight><uline>L</uline></highlight>-fucosidase, known to digest Fuc_alpha1-6GlcNAc, followed by treatment with 13.5 M trifluoroacetic acid to remove the alpha1,3 linked fucose. The de-alpha1,6- and de-alpha1,3-fucosylated oligosaccharide G co-eluted with a known oligosaccharide, allowing the identification of G. The structure of oligosaccharide G is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> The structure of oligosaccharide G was further confirmed by <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H-NMR and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (Hsu et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:9062-9070). Thus, the combination of these techniques can be used to elucidate both known and unknown oligosaccharides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> The carbohydrates attached to IgG from the culture medium and intracellular lysate were identified and the levels present in each source were quantified. These structures were then used in conjunction with previous studies of oligosaccharide processing in insect cells (Altmann et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology </italic></highlight>8:101-114) to generate a detailed map of N-linked oligosaccharide processing in <highlight><italic>Trichoplitsia ni </italic></highlight>insect cells. The pathway and the levels of the oligosaccharides from secreted and intracellular sources are detailed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> The initial processing in the <highlight><italic>T. ni </italic></highlight>cells appears to be similar to the mammalian pathway, including trimming of the terminal glucose and mannose residues. The trimming process follows a linear pathway with the exception of two different forms of the Man<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>GlcNAc<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(M7GN, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> also observed in native insect glycoproteins (Altmann et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology </italic></highlight>8:101-114) and IgG<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, from NS/0 cells (Ip et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>Arch. Biochem. Biophys. </italic></highlight>308:387-399). The presence of these two Man<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>forms suggests the possible existence of an alternative processing pathway that yields Man<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>GlcNAc<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>through the action of endo-alpha-mannosidase. Following cleavage of the mannose residues, GlcNAc (GN) is added to the alpha1,3 branch of Man<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>GlcNAC<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>by GlcNAc TI (N-acetylglusosaminyltransferase I) (Altmann et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology </italic></highlight>8:101-114). However, GlcNAc<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>Man<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>GlcNAC<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>must be a short-lived intermediate quickly processed by alpha-Man II, since this structure was not detected in the <highlight><italic>T. ni </italic></highlight>cell lysate. At the GlcNAc<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, Man<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>GlcNAc<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>oligosaccharide, several branching steps in the N-glycan processing pathway are possible in insect cells. Complex glycoforms can be generated by the action of GlcNAc TII (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II) and Gal T (galactosyltransferase T) to provide oligosaccharides which include terminal GlcNAc (GN) and Gal (G) residues. None of the complex oligosaccharide structures included sialic acid indicating that sialylation is negligible or non-existent in these cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The production of these complex glycoforms must compete with an alternative processing pathway that is catalyzed by N-acetylglucosaminidase (Altmann et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>270:17344-17349) (see Branch Points in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), leading to the production of hybrid and paucimannosidic structures. While the complex-type N-glycans represent 35% of the total secreted glycoforms (supernatant % in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), the majority of secreted N-glycans are either paucimannosidic (35%) or hybrid structures (30%). Furthermore, those complex structures with a branch terminating in Gal represent less than 20% of the total secreted glycoforms and no structures were observed with terminal Gal on both branches of the N-glycan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the secreted glycoforms, the intracellular N-glycans (lysate % in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) obtained from insect cells include more than 50% high-mannose type structures. The fraction of intracellular complex oligosaccharides is less than 15% and only 8% include a terminal Gal residue. The high level of high-mannose structures from intracellular sources indicates significantly less oligosaccharide processing for most of the intracellular immunoglobulins. Many of these intracellular immunoglobulins may not reach the compartments in which carbohydrate trimming takes place (Jarvis et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>9:214-223). High mannose glycoforms are also observed intracellularly for mammalian cells (Jenkins et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Cell Culture Engineering VI</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> The levels of N-linked oligosaccharide processing enzymes are measured using analytical assays to characterize carbohydrate processing in native and recombinant insect cells. These assays are used to compare the N-glycan processing capacity of different cell lines and to evaluate changes in processing and metabolite levels following metabolic engineering modifications. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> HPAEC is used in combination with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) or conductivity to detect metabolite levels in the CMP-SA pathway and to evaluate N-linked oligosaccharide processing enzymes essentially as described by (Lee et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>34:953-957, Lee et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>J. Chromatography A </italic></highlight>720:137-149). Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is an example of the use of HPAEC-PAD for measuring Gal T activity by following the lactose formation reaction: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> The peak labeled &ldquo;Lac&rdquo; indicates the formation of the product lactose (Lac). Many of the enzymes involved in N-glycosylation (e.g., aldolase, CMP-NeuAc synthetase, sialyltransferase) and metabolic intermediates (e.g., sialic acid, CMP-sialic acid, ManNAc, ManNAc-6-phosphate) in the CMP-SA production pathway are measured using this form of chromatography, essentially as described by Lee et al.

<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> To detect native sialyltransferase enzyme activity, <highlight><italic>Trichoplusia ni </italic></highlight>lysates were incubated in the presence of exogenously added CMP-SA and the fluorescent substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl lactoside (Lac-MU). Negligible conversion of the substrate was observed, indicating the absence of endogenous sialyltransferase activity. However, following infection of the insect cells with a baculovirus encoding human alpha2-3-sialyltransferase, conversion of Lac-MU to the product sialyl LacMU was observed in cell lysates using Reverse Phase HPLC and a fluorescence detector (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). For higher sensitivity, Lac-PA (PA&equals;2-aminopyridine) or Lac-ABA (ABA&equals;o-aminobenzamide) are used as substrates. HPLC and HPAEC is used in conjunction with other fluorometric methods detailed in the procedures to analyze the metabolites and enzymatic activities in insect cells. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The previous chromatography techniques have one limitation in that only one sample can be handled at a time. When samples from several cell lines must be assayed, a method such as DELFIA is advantageous since a multiwell fluorometer can simultaneously examine activities in many samples on a microtiter plate (Hemmila et al. (1984) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>137:335-343). The application of such a technique for the measurement of Gal T activity in several different insect cell lysates and controls is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. First, the wells of the microtiter plate are coated with the substrate GlcNAc-BSA (Stowell et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>Meth. in Carb. Chem. </italic></highlight>9:178-181). After incubation with Gal T and UDP-Gal, the well is washed and the Gal residue newly attached to GlcNAc-BSA is measured with europium (Eu<highlight><superscript>&plus;3</superscript></highlight>)-labeled <highlight><italic>Ricinus cummunis </italic></highlight>lectin, which specifically binds Gal or GalNAc structures.

<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> Because the conventional substrates in insect cell media are not efficiently converted to CMP-SA in insect cells as demonstrated by the low levels of CMP-SA, alternative substrates are added to the culture medium. Because sialic acid and CMP-SA are not permeable to cell membranes (Bennetts et al. (1981) <highlight><italic>J. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>88:1-15), they are not considered as appropriate substrates. However, other precursors in the CMP-SA pathway are incorporated into cells and considered as substrates for the generation of CMP-SA in insect cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Incorporation and Conversion of N-Acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> ManNAc has been added to mammalian tissue and cell cultures and enzymatically converted to SA and CMP-SA (Ferwerda et al. (1983) <highlight><italic>Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>216:87-92, Gu et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Improvement of the interferon</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>gamma sialylation in Chinese hamster ovary cell culture by feeding N</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>acetylmannosamine, </italic></highlight>Thomas et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>846:37-43). Consequently, external feeding of ManNAc is examined as one strategy to enhance CMP-SA levels in insect cells. ManNAc is available commercially (Sigma Chemical Co.) or can be prepared chemically from the less expensive feedstock GlcNAc in vitro using sodium hydroxide (Mahmoudian et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Enzyme and Microbial Technology </italic></highlight>20:393-400). Initially, the levels of native cellular ManNAc, if any, is determined using HPAEC-PAD techniques (Lee et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>34:953-957, Lee et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>J. Chromatography A </italic></highlight>720:137-149, Hardy et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>170:54-62, Townsend et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>174:459-470, Kiang et al. (1997) Anal. Biochem. 245:97-101). The ability to increase intracellular ManNAc levels is evaluated by adding ManNAc to cell culture media. Incorporation of exogenous ManNAc is quantified using unlabeled ManNAc if levels of native ManNAc are negligible, or <highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>C- or <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H-labeled ManNAc if significant levels of native ManNAc are present) (Bennetts et al. (1981) <highlight><italic>J. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>88:1-15, Kriesel et al. (1988) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>263:11736-11742). The levels of radioactive ManNAc and other metabolites are determined by collecting ManNAc peaks following HPAEC and measuring the radioactivity using scintillation countering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> To be effective as a substrate for sialylation, the ManNAc must be converted to SA and CMP-SA through intracellular pathways. This conversion is detected directly from externally added ManNAc by following an increase in internal SA and CMP-SA levels using HPAEC or thin layer chromatography (TLC) combined with liquid scintillation counting to detect the radiolabeled metabolites. HPAEC techniques have been used to quantify cellular pools of CMP-SA in as few as 6&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>mammalian cells (Fritsch et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Journal of Chromatography A </italic></highlight>727:223-230), and TLC has been used to evaluate conversion of <highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>C labeled ManNAc to sialic acid in bacteria (Vann et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>7:697-701). If the addition of ManNAc leads to a significant increase in the CMP-SA levels, a limiting step exists in the production of ManNAc from conventional insect cell media substrates. Different ManNAc feeding concentrations are tested and the effect on CMP-SA levels and insect cell viability evaluated to determine if there are any deleterious effects from feeding the ManNAc as substrate. Conversion of ManNAc to SA through the aldolase pathway requires pyruvate, and the addition of cytidine can enhance CMP-SA production from SA (Thomas et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>846:37-43). Thus, pyruvate and cytidine are optionally added to the medium to enhance conversion of ManNAc to CMP-SA (Tomita et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>1243:329-335, Thomas et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>846:37-43). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> Other precursors substrates such as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucosamine are converted to SA and CMP-SA through the ManNAc pathway in eukaryotic cells (Pederson et al.

The disposition of these alternative precursor substrates are monitored using HPAEC analysis using techniques known in the art and compared with ManNAc feeding strategies to determine which substrate provides for the most efficient production of CMP-SA, in particular insect cells. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> It is recognized that insect cells could possess additional N-acetylglucosaminidase enzymes other than the enzyme responsible for generating low-mannose structures, so both recombinant DNA and biochemical approaches are implemented to isolate the target N-acetylglucosaminidase gene. PCR techniques are used to isolate fragments of N-acetylglucosaminidase genes by the same strategies used in isolating alpha-mannosidase cDNAs from Sf-9 cells (Jarvis et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>7:113-127, Kawar et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>7:433-443). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers are designed corresponding to regions of conserved amino acid sequence identified in all N-acetylglucosaminidases described thus far, from human to bacteria, including two lepidopteran insect enzymes (Zen et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>26:435-444). These primers are used to amplify a fragment of the N-acetylglucosaminidase gene(s) from genomic DNA or cDNA of lepidopteran insect cell lines commercially, publicly, or otherwise available for the purposes of this invention. A putative N-acetylglucosaminidase gene fragment from Sf9 genomic DNA and from High Five&trade; cell (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif., USA) cDNA has been identified (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). Similar techniques are used to isolate cDNAs from other insect cell lines of interest. The identification of cDNAs for the Sf9 or High Five&trade; N-acetylglucosaminidase facilitates the isolation of the gene in other insect cell lines. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Since insect cells may have multiple N-acetylglucosaminidases, a biochemical purification approach is also used to broaden the search for the cDNA encoding the target enzyme. A polyclonal antiserum against a <highlight><italic>Manduca sexta </italic></highlight>N-acetylglucosaminidase (Koga et al.

This antiserum is used to probe for the N-acetylglucosaminidase during biochemical isolation techniques. In addition, specific assays for N-acetylglucosaminidase described earlier are used to monitor enzyme activity in isolated biochemical fractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> The target N-acetylglucosaminidase is membrane bound, so it must be solubilized using a detergent such as Triton-X 100 prior to purification. Once solubilized, the enzyme is purified by a combination of gel filtration, ion exchange, and affinity chromatography. For affinity chromatography, the affinants 6-aminohexyl thio-N-acetylglucosaminide (Chipowsky et al. (1973) <highlight><italic>Carbohydr. Res. </italic></highlight>31:339-346) or BSA modified with thio-N-acetylglucosaminide (Lee et al. (1976) <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>15:3956-3963) is tried first. If necessary, 6-aminohexyl a-D-&lsqb;2-(thio-2-amino-2-deoxy-b-D-glucosaminyl)-mannopyranodside or other thio-oligosaccharides are synthesized and used as affinants. Affinity matrices are prepared using commercially available products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the target enzyme is &ldquo;anchored&rdquo; to the membrane by a glycophosphoinositide.

Once the enzyme is sufficiently purified, its amino-terminal region is sequenced by conventional Edman degradation techniques, available commercially. If N-terminal blockage is encountered, the purified protein are digested, peptides purified, and these peptides are used to obtain internal amino acid sequences. The resulting sequence information is used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers that are used, in turn, to isolate cDNAs as described above. </paragraph>

The locations are optionally identified by using the antisera in conjunction with secretory pathway markers, including Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum specific dyes and GFP-tagged N-glycan processing enzymes commercially, publicly, or otherwise available for the purposes of this invention. Evaluation of the N-glycan structures on secreted glycoproteins from insect cells overexpressing the glucosaminidase gene demonstrates the involvement of this enzyme in N-glycan processing as opposed to lysosomal degradation, a common activity for other glucosaminidases. </paragraph>

Confirmation of particular carbohydrate structures is provided by treating the oligosaccharides with glycosidases and re-eluting through the HPLC columns.

<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> This example reports the cloning and characterization of a novel human gene having homology to the <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>sialic acid synthetase gene (neuB). This human gene is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a 40 kD enzyme which results in N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) production in insect cells upon recombinant baculovirus infection. In vitro the human enzyme uses N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphate as substrates to generate phosphorylated forms of Neu5Ac and KDN, respectively, but exhibits much higher activity toward the Neu5Ac phosphate product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> In order to identify genes involved in sialic acid biosynthesis in eukaryotes, homology searches of a human expressed sequence tag (EST) database were performed using the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>sialic acid synthetase gene. A cDNA of approximately 1 kb with a predicted open reading frame (ORF) of 359 amino acids was identified. Northern blot analysis indicated that the mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, and in vitro transcription and translation along with recombinant expression in insect cells demonstrated that the human sialic acid synthetase (SAS) gene encodes a 40 kD protein. SAS rescued an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>neuB mutant although less efficiently than neuB. Neu5Ac production in insect culture supplemented with ManNAc further supported the role of SAS in sialic acid biosynthesis. In addition to Neu5Ac, a second sialic acid, KDN, was generated suggesting that the human enzyme has broad substrate specificity. The human enzyme (SAS), unlike its <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>homologue, uses phosphorylated substrates to generate phosphorylated sialic acids and thus likely represents the previously described sialic acid-9-phosphate synthetase of mammalian cells (Watson et al., <highlight><italic>J.

One EST with significant homology to the neuB gene was found in a human liver cDNA library and used to identify a full length cDNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</cross-reference>) with an ORF homologous to the bacterial synthetase over most of its length. The putative synthetase consisted of 359 amino acids (SEQ ID NO:6) while the neuB gene product contained 346 amino acids (SEQ ID NO:8). Alignment of the human against the bacterial enzyme demonstrated that significant differences were found primarily in the N-terminus (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</cross-reference>). Overall, the two synthetases were found to be 36.1% identical and 56.1% similar at the amino acid level. </paragraph>

After transfection and viral titering, the resulting virus (AcSAS) was used to infect <highlight><italic>Spodoptera frugiperda </italic></highlight>(Sf-9) cells followed by pulse labeling. An &tilde;40 kD band was observed in the Sf-9 lysates from cells infected by AcSAS (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>A, lane 5) and not in the mock infected control (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>A, lane 4). Furthermore, this band co-migrated with the protein produced in vitro. To verify SAS expression, the band was visualized in the non-nuclear fraction (Miyamoto et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>5, 2860-2865 (1985)) after electrophoretic transfer to a ProBlott&trade; membrane and Ponceau S staining (data not shown) and excised for amino acid sequencing. The five N-terminal amino acids were identical to the second through sixth amino acids of the predicted protein (data not shown). Interestingly, the initiator methionine was also removed from the purified recombinant <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>sialic acid synthetase (Vann et al., 1997). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Covalent labeling of sialic acids with the fluorescent reagent 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene dihydrochloride (DMB) allows very specific and sensitive sialic acid detection (Hara et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>179, 162-166 (1989); Manzi et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>188, 20-32 (1990)). The DMB reaction products are identified after separation by reverse phase HPLC chromatography. Using this technique, sialic acid standards were measured in quantities as low as 50 fmol (data not shown). Sialic acid levels of an insect cell line (Sf-9) and a mammalian cell line (Chinese hamster ovary, CHO) were compared (Table 2). The sialic acid content in cell lysates before and after filtration through a 10,000 MWCO membrane was determined by DMB labeling and HPLC separation. The native sialic acid levels in Sf-9 cells grown without fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplementation are substantially lower than the levels found in CHO cells (Table 2; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</cross-reference>). To ensure that the low sialic acid content was not due to the absence of serum, the sialic acid content of insect cells cultured in 10% FBS was determined. Even with FBS addition, the Neu5Ac content of Sf-9 cells is nearly an order of magnitude lower than the content of CHO cells (Table 2). The origin of the sialic acid detected in insect cells, whether natively produced or the result of contamination from the media, is not clear since even serum free insect cell media contains significant levels of sialic acid (data not shown).

<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> The lack of large sialic acid pools in Sf-9 cells grown in serum-free media facilitated the detection of sialic acids produced by recombinant enzymes. In order to examine the production of sialic acids from cells infected with recombinant virus, Sf-9 cells were infected with AcSAS and a negative control virus, A35. The A35 virus was generated by recombining a transfer vector without a gene inserted downstream of the polh promoter. Low levels of Neu5Ac were observed in lysates from insect cells infected by either virus (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</cross-reference>) indicating additional Neu5Ac was not produced following the expression of SAS. However, a significant new peak was seen in AcSAS lysates at 12.5 min. that was not observed in A35 negative control lysates (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</cross-reference>). Published chromatograms suggested the unknown early eluting peak could be N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) or KDN (Inoue et al., 1998). The elution time of the unknown peak was the same as DMB-derivatized KDN standard (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</cross-reference>) and co-chromatographed with authentic DMB-KDN (data not shown) confirming KDN generation in AcSAS infected Sf-9 cells. KDN was not detected in uninfected Sf-9 cells either with or without FBS supplementation (Table 2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> In a further attempt to demonstrate Neu5Ac synthetic functionality, the culture media was supplemented with ManNAc, the metabolic precursor of Neu5Ac. In addition to a DMB-KDN peak, a prominent peak eluting at 17.5 min. corresponding with that of the Neu5Ac standard was observed from the lysates of ManNAc supplemented Sf-9 cells infected with AcSAS (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37C</cross-reference>). Neu5Ac quantities were more than 100 times lower in the uninfected lysates and even less in A35 infected lysates (Table 2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Sialic acid levels were quantified in lysates of uninfected, A35 infected, and AcSAS infected Sf-9 cells grown in media with and without Man, mannosamine (ManN), or ManNAc supplementation (Table 3). In uninfected cells, Man feeding resulted in detection of KDN slightly above background, and ManNAc feeding marginally increased Neu5Ac levels in uninfected and A35 infected cells (Table 3). ManN supplementation had no effect on KDN levels but increased Neu5Ac levels (Table 3). The most significant changes in sialic acid levels occurred with AcSAS infection. AcSAS infection of Sf-9 cells led to large increases in KDN levels with slight enhancements upon Man or ManNAc supplementation. Both AcSAS infection and ManNAc feeding were required to obtain substantial Neu5Ac levels.

Lysates or purified protein plus PEP and MnCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(Angata et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol.

<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> AcSAS infected cell lysates incubated with ManNAc-6-P and PEP produced a peak eluting at 5.5 min (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</cross-reference>) consistent with phosphorylated sugars. In previous studies, phosphorylated KDN was detected as DMB-KDN after alkaline phosphatase (AP) treatment and DMB derivatization (Angata et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>274, 22949-22956 (1999)). Similarly, the peak eluting at 5.5 min. was exchanged for one that eluted at the same time as authentic Neu5Ac following AP treatment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</cross-reference>). Likewise, an early eluting peak from the incubation mixture containing Man-6-P yielded a KDN peak after AP treatment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</cross-reference>). No sialic acid products were detected when A35 infected cell lysates were used in the equivalent assays or when Man or ManNAc were used as substrates (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Assays were performed by incubating lysates with different substrate solution concentrations of Man-6-P and ManNAc-6-P in order to evaluate substrate preference. After incubation for a fixed time period, the samples were treated with AP, and DMB derivatives of Neu5Ac and KDN were quantified and compared (Table 4). When equimolar amounts of substrates are used, Neu5Ac production is significantly favored over KDN especially at higher equimolar concentrations (10 and 20 mM) of the two substrates. Only when the substrate concentration of ManNAc-6-P is substantially lower than the Man-6-P levels are production levels of the two sialic acids comparable. When the ManNAc-6-P concentration is 1 mM and the Man-6-P level is 20 mM, the Neu5Ac:KDN production ratio approaches unity. Therefore, the enzyme prefers ManNAc-6-P over Man-6-P in the production of phosphorylated forms of Neu5Ac and KDN, respectively.

<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> Discussion of Human Sialic Acid Synthetase Characterization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> We have identified the sequence of a human sialic acid phosphate synthetase gene, SAS, whose protein product condenses ManNAc-6-P or Man-6-P with PEP to form Neu5Ac and KDN phosphates, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cloning of a eukaryotic sialic acid phosphate synthetase gene. Despite the importance of sialic acids in many biological recognition phenomena, sialic acid phosphate synthetase genes have not been cloned because the enzymes they encode are unstable and difficult to purify (Watson et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>241, 5627-5636 (1966); Angata et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>274, 22949-22956 (1999)). Even the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>sialic acid synthetase enzyme, whose sequence is known, has low specific activity and is unstable (Vann et al., <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>7, 697-701 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> Consequently, a bioinformatics approach based on the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>synthetase sequence was used to identify a putative human gene 36% identical and 56% similar to neuB. In vitro transcription and translation verified an open reading frame which encoded a 359 amino acid protein. In addition, Northern blots revealed ubiquitous transcription of the human synthetase gene in a selection of human tissues. The wide distribution of SAS mRNA is consistent with the detection of sialic acids in many different mammalian tissues (Inoue and Inoue, <highlight><italic>Sialobiology and Other Novel Forms of Glycosylation </italic></highlight>(Osaka, Japan: Gakushin Publishing) pp.57-67 (1999)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> Using the baculovirus expression system, the 40 kD sialic acid phosphate synthetase enzyme, SAS, was expressed in cells. The use of Sf-9 cells which have little if any native sialic acid greatly facilitated the detection of sialic acids and the characterization of SAS. However, Neu5Ac was observed only when insect cells were infected with AcSAS and the cell culture media was supplemented with ManNAc, a sialic acid precursor. This ManNAc feeding requirement indicates that Sf-9 cells may lack sizeable ManNAc pools and synthetic pathways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> SAS was identified based on homology with neuB whose enzyme product directly forms Neu5Ac from ManNAc and PEP (Vann et al., <highlight><italic>Glycobiology </italic></highlight>7, 697-701 (1997)). Furthermore, insect cells produce Neu5Ac following recombinant SAS expression and ManNAc supplementation. However, mammalian cells are known only to produce Neu5Ac from ManNAc through a three-step pathway with phosphorylated intermediates. Therefore, in vitro assays were performed to determine the substrate specificity of SAS. Both AcSAS infected insect cell lysates and protein purified from the prokaryotic expression system were assayed using ManNAc and ManNAc-6-P as possible substrates. A rapidly eluting DMB derivatized product, typical of a phosphorylated sialic acid, was observed only when ManNAc-6-P was used as the substrate. Furthermore, this peak disappears with the appearance of an unsubstituted DMB-Neu5Ac peak following AP treatment. SAS therefore condenses PEP and ManNAc-6-P to form a Neu5Ac phosphate product. Although the exact position of the phosphorylated carbon on the product has not yet been specified, SAS is likely the sialic acid phosphate synthetase enzyme of the previously described three-step mammalian pathway (Kundig et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>241, 5619-5626 (1966); Watson et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>241, 5627-5636 (1966); Jourdian et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>239, PC2714-PC2716 (1964)). Despite little if any native pools of sialic acids, Sf-9 cells natively possess the ability to complete the three-step mammalian pathway when only the sialic acid phosphate synthetase gene is provided. Sf-9 cells have been shown to have substantial ManNAc kinase ability (Effertz et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>274, 28771-28778 (1999)), and phosphatase activity has also been detected in insect cells (Sukhanova et al., <highlight><italic>Genetika </italic></highlight>34, 1239-1242 (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> The capacity to produce sialic acids in Sf-9 cells following AcSAS infection and ManNAc supplementation at levels even higher than those seen in a mammalian cell lines such as CHO may help overcome a major limitation of the baculovirus expression system. N-glycans of recombinant glycoproteins produced in insect cells lack significant levels of terminal sialic acid residues (Jarvis and Finn, <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>212, 500-511 (1995); Ogonah et al., <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>14, 197-202 (1996)). The lack of sialylation on human thyrotropin produced by the baculovirus expression system resulted in rapid in vivo thyrotropin clearance as compared to thyrotropin produced by a mammalian system (Grossmann et al., <highlight><italic>Endocrinology </italic></highlight>138, 92-100 (1997)). Generation of significant sialic acid pools along with expression of other genes such as sialyltransferases may lead to production of significant levels of sialylated glycoproteins in insect cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Another interesting observation was the occurrence of a second DMB reactive peak in AcSAS infected Sf-9 lysates. This peak has been identified as KDN, a deaminated Neu5Ac. We subsequently demonstrated that the SAS enzyme generates KDN phosphate from Man-6-P and PEP in vitro. While Neu5Ac production in insect cells requires both AcSAS infection and ManNAc supplementation, only AcSAS infection is necessary for KDN synthesis. Therefore, significant substrate pools for the generation of KDN already exist in insect cells or are present in the media. In addition, mannose feeding increased KDN production even further. Interestingly, Man feeding of the uninfected insect cells increased KDN levels above background, and ManNAc feeding also led to higher Neu5Ac levels in uninfected cells. Therefore, insect cells may possess limited native sialic acid synthetic ability. Similar substrate supplementation results have been reported in mammalian cells, as cultivation in Man-rich or ManNAc-rich media enhanced the synthesis of native intracellular KDN and Neu5Ac, respectively (Angata et al., <highlight><italic>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </italic></highlight>261, 326-331 (1999)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> This study is the first report of a eukaryotic gene encoding any enzyme with KDN synthetic ability. Recently, KDN enzymatic activity has been characterized in trout testis, a tissue high in KDN content. KDN is synthesized from Man in trout through a three-step pathway involving a synthetase with a Man-6-P substrate (Angata et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>274, 22949-22956 (1999)). However, the fish synthetase enzyme, partially purified from trout testis, was approximately 80 kD as compared to the human enzyme of 40 kD. Furthermore, KDN and Neu5Ac phosphate synthesis in trout were likely catalyzed by two separate synthetase activities (Angata et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>274, 22949-22956 (1999)) while the current study indicates that both products were generated from a single human enzyme with broad substrate specificity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> Neu5Ac, usually bound to glycoconjugates, is the predominant sialic acid found in mammalian tissue, but KDN, primarily found free in the ethanol soluble fractions, has also been detected all human tissues examined so far (Inoue and Inoue, <highlight><italic>Sialobiology and Other Novel Forms of Glycosylation </italic></highlight>(Osaka, Japan: Gakushin Publishing, pp.57-67 (1999)). The ratio of Neu5Ac to KDN is on the order of 100:1 in blood cells and ovaries (Inoue et al., 1998), although this ratio may change during development and cancer. The levels of free KDN in newborn fetal cord red blood cells are higher than those of maternal red blood cells (Inoue et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>273, 27199-27204 (1998)). Furthermore, a 4.2 fold increase in the ratio of free KDN to free Neu5Ac was observed in ovarian tumor cells as compared to normal cells, and the ratio appears to increase with the extent of invasion or malignancy for ovarian adenocarcinomas (Inoue et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>273, 27199-27204 (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> Because the KDN/Neu5Ac ratio has biological significance, we performed competitive in vitro assays with insect cell lysates using both ManNAc-6-P and Man-6-P as substrates. SAS demonstrated a preference for phosphorylated Neu5Ac over phosphorylated KDN synthesis in vitro, although the concentrations of the particular substrates relative to the enzyme level altered this production ratio. Thus changes in the ratios of free KDN to Neu5Ac observed in different developmental states and cancer tissue may reflect variability either in the levels of specific substrates or the amount of active enzyme present in vivo. The identification of the SAS genetic sequence and characterization of the enzyme it encodes should help further our understanding of sialic acid biosynthesis as well as the roles sialic acids play in development and disease states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> the production of sialylated nucleotides in SF-9 insect cells following infection with human CMP-SA synthetase and SA synthetase containing baculoviruses is demonstrated. Sf-9 cells were grown in six well plates and infected with baculovirus containing CMP-SA synthase and supplemented with 10 mM ManNAc (&ldquo;CMP&rdquo; line), baculovirus containing CMP-SA synthase and SA synthase plus 10 mM ManNAc supplementation (&ldquo;CMP&plus;SA&rdquo; line), or no baculovirus and no ManNAc supplementation (&ldquo;SF9&rdquo; line). The nucleotide sugars from lysed cells were extracted with 75% ethanol, dried, resuspended in water, and filtered through a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane. Samples were then separated on a Dionex Carbopac PA-1 column using a Shimadzu VP series HPLC. Nucleotide sugars were detected based upon their absorbance at 280 nm, and CMP sialic acid standards were shown to elute at approximately 7 minutes. These results demonstrate the ability to produce the desired oligosaccharide products in insect cells via introduction and expression of sialyltransferase enzymes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> Recombinant glycoproteins are increasingly used as therapeutic agents, and post-translational modifications to these proteins can significantly affect their properties and value. N-glycosylation is a particularly important modification that can affect solubility, biological activity, and in vivo circulatory half-life<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>. Mammalian cell lines produce glycoproteins with complex-type glycan patterns typically terminating in sialic acid residues. While insect cells N-glycosylate secretory and membrane proteins, the final N-glycosylation pattern includes mostly high mannose or paucimannosidic (low mannose) structures<highlight><superscript>2, 3</superscript></highlight>. Some oligosaccharides terminating in N-acetylglucosamine or galactose have also been observed<highlight><superscript>2, 3</superscript></highlight>. Expression of recombinant galactosyltransferases has increased the relative amounts of galactose terminating N-glycans<highlight><superscript>4-6</superscript></highlight>. The differences between mammalian and insect glycosylation can have a significant impact on a protein&apos;s characteristics. For example, the in vitro activity of recombinant human thyrotropin expressed in insect cells was five times higher than that produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), yet the in vivo activity of CHO thyrotropin was higher in mice<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>. The reason for this difference in activity was thought to be a more rapid clearance of the insect produced thyrotropin due to the absence of terminal sialic acid residues<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> The sialylation of glycoproteins requires the metabolic generation of the sugar nucleotide cytidine monosphospho-sialic acid (CMP-SA) followed by the transfer of the sialic acid to an acceptor oligosaccharide in the Golgi apparatus by sialyltransferases. Previous studies indicate that insect cells have undetectable levels of the most common sialic acid nucleotide, CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac)<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>as well as negligible levels of its metabolic precursor, Neu5Ac<highlight><superscript>9</superscript></highlight>. Since CMP-Neu5Ac and Neu5Ac are not easily incorporated into cells<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>, alternative strategies should be considered for generating sufficient Neu5Ac and CMP-Neu5Ac for sialylation in insect cells. One approach is to engineer the necessary enzymatic pathways for CMP-SA synthesis. Unlike Neu5Ac or CMP-Neu5Ac, the precursor to Neu5Ac, N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc)<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>, and its analogs<highlight><superscript>11, 12 </superscript></highlight>are readily incorporated into cells. In fact, feeding of ManNAc in concert with the expression of the recently cloned sialic acid phosphate synthase gene generated large intracellular pools of Neu5Ac in insect cells<highlight><superscript>9</superscript></highlight>. In the case of mammalian cells, Neu5Ac is subsequently activated to the nucleotide sugar CMP-Neu5Ac by CMP-sialic acid synthase<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>. While the activity of CMP-SAS has been described since 1962<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>, the gene has only recently been cloned in <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>and mouse<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> Using homology searches based on the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>sequence (neuA), the novel human Cmp-Sas gene of the present invention was identified and cloned it into a transfer vector to produce the recombinant baculovirus (AcCMP-SAS). In order to determine if insect cells could be modified to generate CMP-SA pools, Sf-9 cells were co-infected with AcCMP-SAS and the baculovirus containing the recombinant human sialic acid phosphate synthase (AcSAS) of the present invention in the presence of ManNAc. The result was the production of large pools of intracellular CMP-Neu5Ac, overcoming a major limitation to the sialylation of glycoproteins in insect cells. Interestingly, another sugar nucleotide, CMP-2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (CMP-KDN), was generated in insect cells following infection with AcSAS and AcCMP-SAS when not supplemented by ManNAc. The ability to generate either CMP-Neu5Ac or CMP-KDN in separate cell cultures presents the potential for generating glycoproteins with different sialic acid termini in insect cells. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> Gene Identification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> The human CMP-sialic acid synthase gene was identified using homology searches based on the known bacterial CMP-sialic acid synthase gene<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>. Over the entire sequences, the putative human gene is 23% identical and 47% similar to the bacterial sequence and 92% identical and 94% similar to the murine sequence. Northern blots probing human mRNA samples using the gene sequence showed ubiquitous transcription of the gene in all human tissues tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> Using in vitro transcription and translation, the putative gene was shown to encode a protein of the expected molecular weight. The same gene was used to generate AcCMP-SAS, and this virus was used to infect Sf-9 cells. Pulse labeling followed by SDS-PAGE separation showed a protein of 49 kDa, consistent with the predicted weight of 48.5 kDa, that was not observed in the control infection (A35). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> The function of the putative gene product was determined in vitro using cell lysates incubated with the precursors N-acetylneuraminic acid and cytidine triphosphate based on the published thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay<highlight><superscript>17</superscript></highlight>. CMP-SA synthetic ability is observed only in Sf-9 cells following AcCMP-SAS infection and was not detectable in control infected or uninfected cells. Furthermore, infection with the AcCMP-SAS provides 60 times the activity of the native CMP-SA synthetic ability of CHO cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> Enzyme Localization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> CMP-sialic acid synthetic activity in mammals has been shown to localize to the nucleus<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>, and fluorescent labeling of the recombinant murine enzyme expressed in 3T3 cells confirmed this localization<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>. Analysis of the human CMP-SAS sequence with the pSORT algorithm also predicted the protein would localize to the nucleus because of the nuclear localization sequence (KRPR) starting at amino acid 199. To determine if the recombinant human enzyme localized to the nucleus of insect cells, a nuclear separation using the Pierce NE-PER&trade; kit was performed. A protein band from the AcCMP-SAS infection was found predominantly in the nuclear fraction but not in the nuclear fraction of a control infection. In contrast, recombinant SAS localized in the cytoplasmic fraction and not the nuclear fraction as observed previously for the native enzyme in mammalian cells<highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>. TBA assays of the nuclear fraction showed CMP-SAS activity of AcCMP-SAS infected but not AcSAS infected cells. The protein band in the nuclear fraction following a detergent separation<highlight><superscript>19 </superscript></highlight>was also transferred to a PDF membrane for N-terminal protein sequencing. The sequence was identical to amino acids 29 through 33 as predicted from the gene sequence indicating cleavage of the first 28 amino acids of the nuclear localized protein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> The production of Neu5Ac in insect cells has been accomplished by infection with the recombinant human sialic acid phosphate synthase virus (AcSAS) in concert with feeding of the precursor ManNAc<highlight><superscript>9</superscript></highlight>. Coinfection of AcSAS and AcCMP-SAS with concomitant ManNAc feeding was attempted in order to produce and activate sialic acids in insect cells. Proteins of the expected molecular weights and cellular locations are seen in lysates of cells infected with each virus individually and together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> A procedure was developed to measure CMP-Neu5Ac by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) using UV monitoring. Using this technique, samples from different infection strategies were examined, and the levels of CMP-Neu5Ac produced on a protein basis are listed in Table 5, below. In agreement with previous work<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>, CHO cells are shown to have measurable CMP-Neu5Ac levels which are augmented upon feeding of 10 mM ManNAc. Uninfected Sf-9 cells grown in serum-free medium do not have detectable CMP-Neu5Ac levels with or without ManNAc feeding. Large CMP-Neu5Ac levels are produced in insect cells only when all three components of the sialic acid pathway are present: the precursor sugar ManNAc, the sialic acid phosphate synthase from AcSAS, and the CMP-sialic acid synthase from AcCMP-SAS. In this case, CMP-Neu5Ac levels are approximately 6 times those seen in CHO with ManNAc feeding and 30 times without ManNAc feeding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> When ManNAc feeding is omitted from an AcSAS and AcCMP-SAS infection, a CMP-Neu5Ac peak is not observed but a peak eluting at 8.5 min. is detected. This peak has the same elution time as authentic CMP-KDN and is found in quantities of 4 pmol/&mgr;g protein. Further confirmation of the peak as CMP-KDN was obtained by acid hydrolysis of the eluted peak followed by fluorescent labeling with DMB and HPLC separation. The resulting fluorescent compound eluted at the same elution time as authentic KDN (data not shown). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Discussion of Example 7 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> The baculovirus expression system offers several advantages including the capacity to generate significant levels of post-translationally modified recombinant proteins in a eucaryotic cell line. However, one of the drawbacks of recombinant baculovirus expression is its inability to produce glycoproteins with sizable fractions having complex-type N-glycans, especially those terminating in sialic acid residues. Sialic acids have been associated with numerous in vivo biological processes including development<highlight><superscript>20</superscript></highlight>, pathogen infectivity<highlight><superscript>21</superscript></highlight>, ligand-receptor interactions<highlight><superscript>21</superscript></highlight>, cancer metastasis<highlight><superscript>22</superscript></highlight>, and the elimination of non-sialylated glycoproteins by the asialoglycoprotein receptor<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> Although Sf-9 cells do not contain detectable native pools of CMP-Neu5Ac, this bottleneck to sialylation has been overcome by substrate feeding and engineering the CMP-SA synthesis genes into insect cells. The human CMP-sialic acid synthase gene has been identified and expressed in an active form in insect cells. The enzyme localizes to the nucleus of insect cells as observed in the native mammalian host to suggest that the encoded nuclear localization signals are functional in insect cells as well. Moreover, the protein isolated from the nuclear fraction retains enzyme activity, but interestingly its first 28 amino acids are truncated as determined by N-terminal protein sequencing analysis. This cleavage may explain the lower molecular weight of the protein band observed in the nuclear fraction of the Coomassie stained gel as compared to the radiolabeled protein in the total cell lysate. The cause of the cleavage of the nuclear localized CMP-SA synthase is unknown as is the relevance of this cleavage to the nuclear localization process in insect cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> By feeding ManNAc along with expression of CMP-SAS and SAS, CMP-Neu5Ac levels more than five times higher than those observed in ManNAc supplemented CHO cells are achieved in Sf-9 cells. Some low level endogenous sialic acid metabolic activity may be present in insect cells as seen with the addition of ManNAc and just one component of the pathway (Table 5). However, CMP-levels are increased more than 100-fold by the addition of all three components. In order to complete sialylation, the CMP-Neu5Ac must be transported into the Golgi where a sialyltransferase can transfer the Neu5Ac to the target acceptor oligosaccharide. Expression of recombinant sialyltransferases and a CMP-sialic acid transporter may also be required to achieve sialylation in insect cell culture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> Interestingly, an alternative nucleotide sugar, CMP-KDN, is produced in insect cells co-expressing CMP-SAS and SAS without ManNAc feeding. Previously, we observed the production of KDN when insect cells expressed SAS in the absence of ManNAc. Therefore, both SAS and CMP-SAS must recognize the substrates for generating deaminated sialic acid forms. More significant is the observation that the CMP-KDN is generated in the absence of detectable levels of CMP-Neu5Ac. This is the first report of a cellular system that can produce substantial levels of activated KDN without activated Neu5Ac. Since at least one sialyltransferase recognizes both CMP-KDN as well as CMP-Neu5Ac<highlight><superscript>23</superscript></highlight>, this expression system may eventually allow the exclusive KDNylation of glycoproteins. KDN was first identified in 1986<highlight><superscript>24</superscript></highlight>, and its effects on function and activity of a sialylated glycoprotein are largely unknown. However, elevated KDN:Neu5Ac levels have been observed in tissues during biological phenomena of great interest such as cancer and development<highlight><superscript>25</superscript></highlight>. In addition glycoproteins sialylated by KDN rather than Neu5Ac may be less susceptible to sialidases<highlight><superscript>24</superscript></highlight>. Such proteins could have longer in vivo circulatory half-lives and potentially greater pharmaceutical value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the capacity to enhance sialylation by engineering the CMP-SA pathway may have significance beyond the baculovirus expression system. Reports have suggested that limitations in levels of activated sialic acids may exist in mammalian cell lines as well<highlight><superscript>26</superscript></highlight>. Other expression systems such as yeast and plant cells may also lack some of the genes involved in generating CMP-SA so the pathway may be engineered into other recombinant hosts. In these cases, the sialyltransferases and the enzymes involved in sugar nucleotide transport may also be needed. Thus, in accordance with the invention, the number of cellular species that can generate complex &ldquo;mammalian-like&rdquo; glycoforms during recombinant protein expression may be increased through the metabolic engineering of the CMP-SA synthetic and transfer pathways. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Conclusion of Example 7 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> In summary, to increase substrate levels, the enzymes of the metabolic pathway for CMP-SA synthesis have been engineered into insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. A novel human CMP-sialic acid synthase gene (Cmp-Sas) was identified based on homology to the corresponding <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>gene. The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is active in baculovirus-infected insect cells where it localizes to the nucleus as it does in mammalian cells. Co-expression of Cmp-Sas with the novel sialic acid phosphate synthase (SAS) of the present invention in concert with N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) feeding yields intracellular CMP-Neu5Ac levels 30 times higher than those observed in unsupplemented CHO cells. The absence of any one of these three components abolishes CMP-Neu5Ac production in vivo. However, when ManNAc feeding is omitted, the sugar nucleotide form of deaminated Neu5Ac, CMP-2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (CMP-KDN), is produced instead indicating that alternative sialic acid glycoforms may eventually be possible in insect cells. Engineering the CMP-SA metabolic pathway may be beneficial in various cell lines in which CMP-Neu5Ac production limits sialylation of glycoproteins or other glycans. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to the production of quinic acid and more specifically, to methods of producing quinic acid and derivatives of quinic acid from the bioconversion of a carbon source. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Quinic acid is an attractive chiral synthon with its highly functionalized, six-membered carbocyclic ring and multiple asymmetric centers. Both hydroquinone and benzoquinone, which are industrially important organic compounds, can be derived by magnesium (IV) dioxide oxidation of quinic acid. Woskrensensky, A., Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 27:257 (1838). Quinic acid is an important molecule utilized as an enantiomerically pure starting material for the synthesis of various molecules, many of which are biologically important. For example, quinic acid is a useful starting material for the synthesis of FK-506, an immune suppressive agent useful in preventing organ transplant rejection. Rao, A. V. R. et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 32:547 (1990). Additionally, quinic acid has been utilized in the synthesis of the neuraminidase inhibitor GS401 and GS4104, an important new pharmaceutical for the treatment of influenza. Barco, A. et al., Tetrahedron Asymmetry 8:3515 (1997). It is also utilized as a convenient source for the synthesis of many natural products that are otherwise difficult to obtain (e.g., mycosporin and D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate. White et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem Soc. </italic></highlight>111(24):8970 (1989); Faick et al., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem. </italic></highlight>54(25):5851 (1989), respectively. In addition, quinic acid is utilized as a food additive, resolving agent and is being used experimentally in optical materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Quinic acid has previously been isolated from natural sources (e.g., cinchona bark, tobacco leaves, carrot leaves, etc.). However, the cost of isolating quinic acid from such sources precludes its use as an economically viable starting material. Quinic acid has been synthesized chemically, but such synthesis utilizes organic solvents, highly reactive reagents and hazardous waste and as&mdash;such is not environmentally desirable. Therefore, there is a need for a cost effective, environmentally desirable method for the synthesis of quinic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,236 describes a method for quinic acid production that uses a heterologous biocatalyst in which expression of quinate dehydrogenase from the <highlight><italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae </italic></highlight>qad gene in <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>results in conversion of 3-dehydroquinic acid (DHQ) into quinic acid. Fermentation of this organism, <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>AB2848aroD/pKD136/pTW8090A (ATCC 69086) produces a mixture of quinic acid, DHQ, and 3-dehydroshikimic acid (DHS). While the relative molar ratio of the three products varies with fermentation conditions, the molar ratio of quinic acid to DHQ and to DHS fails to exceed 2:1:1. The appearance of DHQ as a major byproduct is likely due to product inhibition of quinate dehydrogenase by quinic acid. Alternatively, the specific activity of quinate dehydrogenase may be low due to poor expression of the Klebsiella gene in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>or due to instability of the plasmid carrying the qad locus. The appearance of DHS may represent some instability in the host organism itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Hydroquinone is a pseudocommodity chemical used in photographic developers, polymerization inhibitors and antioxidants. Annual production of hydroquinones is in the 40,000-50,000 ton range. Krumenacher, L. et al. Hydroquinone is currently synthesized via hydroperoxidation of p-diisopropylbenzene as well as oxidation of aniline or hydroxylation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide. U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,236; Krumenacher, L. et al. Aniline, phenol, or p-diisopropylbenzene are produced from carcinogenic benzene starting material, which is obtained from nonrenewable fossil fuel feedstocks. Methods have also been described for converting quinic acid to hydroquinone. U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,236. The quinic acid is over oxidized to benzoquinone via hydroquinone, and the benzoquinone is then converted back to hydroquinone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It would thus be desirable to provide a method for the production of quinic acid, which method utilizes a carbon source as a starting material which can be derived from a renewable resource. It would also be desirable to provide a method for the production of quinic acid in which quinic acid is the major product at high concentrations compared to by-products such as DHQ and DHS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It would also be desirable to provide a method for the production of hydroquinone from quinic acid. It would be further desirable for the method to be inexpensive and utilize non-toxic and non-carcinogenic reactants. It would also be desirable for such a method to produce high-purity hydroquinone in good yields without overoxidation of quinic acid to benzoquinone. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A bioengineered synthesis scheme for the production of quinic acid from a carbon source is provided herein. Methods of producing quinic acid from a carbon source based on the synthesis scheme of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are also provided. Methods for converting quinic acid to hydroquinone are provided as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a method is provided wherein the carbon source is converted to quinic acid by a recombinant microbe. Manipulation of the common aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway of the microbe results in a significant production of quinic acid when the recombinant microbe is cultured in the presence of a carbon source. The carbon source is converted to 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) which is subsequently converted by 3-dehydroquinate synthase to 3-dehydroquinate (DHQ) which is then reduced to quinic acid by shikimate dehydrogenase (d, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The conversion of 3-dehydroquinate to quinic acid was discovered when studying the production of shikimic acid in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>SP1.1/pKD12.112 from a carbon source as described in Specific Example 1. Quinic acid biosynthesis is surprising given the absence in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>of quinate dehydrogenase which catalyzes the interconversion of 3-dehydroquinate and quinic acid. This unprecedented activity of shikimate dehydrogenase in the interconversion of 3-dehydroquinate and quinic acid has been confirmed by incubating 3-dehydroquinate with purified shikimate dehydrogenase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Quinic acid biosynthesis, while widespread in plants, has only been observed in a single microbe, <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>AB2848aroD/pKD136/pTW8090A. Draths, K. M. et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>114:9725 (1992); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,236. This heterologous construct expresses quinate dehydrogenase encoded by the qad locus isolated from <highlight><italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae. </italic></highlight>Mitsuhashi, S. et al., <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>15:268 (1954). Quinate dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of quinic acid is driven by catabolic consumption of the resulting 3-dehydroquinic acid via the &bgr;-ketoadipate pathway in <highlight><italic>K. pneumoniae </italic></highlight>and other microbes. Reduction of 3-dehydroquinic acid by quinate dehydrogenase dominates in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>AB2848aroD/pKD136/pTW8090A because of the absence of 3-dehydroquinic acid catabolism. Quinic acid synthesis in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>SP1.1/pKD12.112 thus implicates the existence of an oxidoreductase which reduces 3-dehydroquinic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The bioconversion methods of the present invention are carried out under conditions of time, temperature, pH, nutrient type and concentration, aeration conditions, and controlled glucose concentrations, to provide maximal conversion of the carbon source to quinic acid. As described in detail in Specific Example 2, in a preferred embodiment, a fed-batch fermentor is used to convert the carbon source to quinic acid, followed by isolation of the quinic acid from the fermentation broth by ion-exchange chromatography. The batch fermentor process and chromatography methods are also known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the phrase &ldquo;carbon source&rdquo; is meant to include biomass derived carbon sources including, but not limited to, xylose, arabinose, glycerol, glucose and the intermediates in the Krebs cycle (e.g., dicarboxylic acids), either alone or in combination. In a preferred embodiment, the carbon source is glucose. The carbon source may be derived from renewable resources such as, without limitation, corn, sugar, beets and sugar cane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the recombinant microbe employed in the methods of the present invention is <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight>In a preferred embodiment, the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>comprises a mutated aroD locus and an aroB cassette inserted into the serA locus. This recombinant <highlight><italic>E. coli, </italic></highlight>designated QP1.1, may further comprise a plasmid carrying aroF<highlight><superscript>FBR</superscript></highlight>, aroE and serA gene inserts. The blocking or impeding of aroD-encoded 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (c, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) results in the accumulation of 3-dehydroquinate which is subsequently converted to quinic acid. It will be appreciated, however, that the aroD locus mutation is not essential and is employed to further provide 3-dehydroquinate and to decrease the formation of 3-dehydroshikimate acid. The aroB gene insert encodes 3-dehydroquinate synthase (b, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), increasing the production of 3-dehydroquinate. The 3-dehydroquinate is converted into quinic acid by plasmid-localized aroE-encoded shikimate dehydrogenase (d, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the recombinant <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>comprises plasmid pKD12.112 carrying aroF<highlight><superscript>FBR</superscript></highlight>, serA and aroe gene inserts. The aroF<highlight><superscript>FBR </superscript></highlight>gene insert encodes a mutant 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase isozyme (a, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) insensitive to feedback inhibition by aromatic amino acids or other aromatic molecules which increases carbon flow into the common aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway. Due to a mutation in the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>genomic serA locus required for L-serine biosynthesis, growth in minimal salts medium and plasmid maintenance follows from expression of plasmid-localized serA. The serA insert thus allows microbial growth in minimal salts medium, distinguishing the microbes containing the plasmid from non-plasmid containing microbes. The aroE gene insert encodes a 3-shikimate dehydrogenase, increasing the production of quinic acid. Preferably, the aroE gene is from <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight>More preferably, all the inserted genes are from <highlight><italic>E. coli, </italic></highlight>producing a homogenous recombinant <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the aroF<highlight><superscript>FBR</superscript></highlight>, serA and/or aroE genes are inserted directly into the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>genome along with aroB. Such a recombinant <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>would not require a plasmid to produce significant amounts of quinic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The above-described preferred recombinant microbe of the present invention, <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>QP1.1/pKD12.112, has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20582, under the terms of the Budapest Treaty, and has been accorded the ATCC designation number 98904. The deposit will be maintained in the ATCC depository, which is a public depository, for a period of 30 years, or 5 years after the most recent request, or for the effective life of a patent, whichever is longer, and will be replaced if the deposit becomes depleted or nonviable during that period. Samples of the deposit will become available to the public and all restrictions imposed on access to the deposit will be removed upon grant of a patent on this application. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Although <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>is specifically described herein as the microbe for carrying out the methods of the present invention, it will be appreciated that any microorganism such as the common types cited in the literature and known to those skilled in the art, may be employed, provided the microorganism can be altered to effect the desired conversion (e.g., carbon source to quinic acid, carbon source to 3-dehydroquinate, 3-dehydroquinate to quinic acid, etc.) Thus, it is envisaged that many types of fungi, bacteria and yeasts will work in the methods of the present invention. Such microorganisms may be developed, for example, through selection, mutation, and/or genetic transformation processes with the characteristic and necessary capability of converting one constituent of the synthesis scheme of the present invention to another. Methods for such development are well known to the skilled practitioner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In order to carry out the bioconversion methods of the present invention, a solution containing a carbon source is contacted with the recombinant microbe to form a bioconversion mixture which is maintained under appropriate conditions to promote the conversion of the carbon source to the desired constituent, e.g., quinic acid. In a preferred embodiment, the bioconversion mixture is maintained at a temperature of about 30&deg; C. to about 37&deg; C. and a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5. It is preferred that the bioconversion mixture also contain other substances necessary to promote the viability of the recombinant microbes such as mineral salts, buffers, cofactors, nutrient substances and the like. The bioconversion mixture is preferably maintained in a steady state under glucose limited conditions. In a preferred method the rate of glucose addition is determined by the level of dissolved oxygen concentration. A preferred steady state over the course of fermentation is about 100 to about 200 &mgr;mol glucose or a dissolved oxygen concentration of about 5% to about 35% air saturation. The more general requirements for the maintenance of viability of microorganisms are well known and specific requirements for maintaining the viability of specific microorganisms are also well known as documented in the literature, or are otherwise easily determined by those skilled in the art. The quinic acid may then be recovered from the bioconversion mixture by methods known in the art (e.g., ion-exchange chromatography) and further purified by recrystallization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Novel methods for converting quinic acid to hydroquinone are also provided. In one embodiment, a method is provided wherein oxidation of quinic acid and heating of the oxidation product yields hydroquinone. In one embodiment, quinic acid is oxidized to 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone which is then heated to produce hydroquinone (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the quinic acid is oxidized to 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone wherein the oxidation is catalyzed by an oxidizing agent. In a preferred embodiment, the oxidizing agent oxidizes quinic acid to 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone but not to benzoquinone. Preferably, the oxidizing agent is chosen from the group comprising HOCl, (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>/NaOCl), AgNO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ce(NO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, NA<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>VO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or 2KHSO<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>.KHSO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(oxone)/NaCl. More preferably, the oxidizing agent is selected from the group comprising HOCl or AgNO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Most preferably, the HOCl is formed in situ by acidifying commercial bleach (NaOCl) in the oxidation reaction mixture. The amount of oxidizing agent required is preferably about 1.0 equivalents relative to quinic acid. Alternatively, the oxidizing agent is present in catalytic amounts of less than about 1.0 equivalents along with at least 1.0 equivalents of a cooxidant. For example, 0.1 equivalents of AgNO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can effectively oxidize quinic acid in the presence of 1.2 equivalents of K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the cooxidant is present to regenerate the oxidizing agent such that only catalytic amounts of the oxidizing agent are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the oxidation reaction is carried out in an aqueous quinic acid solution. In a preferred embodiment, the aqueous quinic acid solution is a purified quinic acid fermentation broth (see Specific Example 3). In an alternate embodiment, the aqueous quinic acid solution is comprised of isolated quinic acid and water. The yield of hydroquinone may be dependent on both the aqueous quinic acid solution and the oxidizing agent. When the reaction was carried out in purified quinic acid fermentation broth, the yield of hydroquinone was 57% (mol/mol) with acidified commercial bleach, 55% (mol/mol) with (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ce(NO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and 64% (mol/mol) with V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>as the oxidants. However, when AgNO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>was the oxidant, with K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>as the cooxidant, the yield of hydroquinone from purified quinic acid fermentation broth was only 35% (mol/mol) whereas the yield was increased to 80% (mol/mol) when the aqueous solution comprised purified quinic acid in water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone is dehydrated to produce hydroquinone. In a preferred embodiment, the 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone is not isolated after the oxidation reaction. After oxidation of quinic acid to 3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanone, the reaction mixture is then heated to produce hydroquinone. When HOCI is the oxidizing agent, the oxidation reaction mixture is neutralized before heating. The hydroquinone can then be purified from the reaction mixture by methods known in the art (e.g., extraction, flash chromatography). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Culturing SP1.1/pKD12.112 for 42 h with K<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.1 resulted in the synthesis of 27.2 g/L of shikimic acid, 12.6 g/L of quinic acid, and 4.4 g/L of 3-dehydroshikimic acid (DHS). DHS accumulation reflected the expected feedback inhibition of shikimate dehydrogenase by shikimic acid. Draths, K. M. et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>114:9726 (1992); Dell, et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>115:1158 (1993). By contrast, quinic acid biosynthesis was surprising given the absence in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>of quinic acid dehydrogenase which catalyzes 3-dehydroquinate and quinic acid interconversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Quinic acid formation was further explored by collecting SP1.1/pKD12.112 cells from the fermentor after 24 h. Washed cells were resuspended in fresh fermentation medium containing shikimic acid and shaken. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, formation of quinic acid (solid bars) and 3-dehydroshikimate (hatched bars) along with a corresponding decrease in shikimic acid (open bars) concentration indicated that SP1.1/pKD12.112 was transporting shikimic acid into its cytosol. Brown, K. D. et al., <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>428:550 (1976). Since both shikimate dehydrogenase and 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase catalyze reversible reactions, cytosolic shikimic acid could be converted back into 3-dehydroquinate. Shikimate dehydrogenase might then play a dual role by also catalyzing 3-dehydroquinate reduction. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Fermentations employed a 2.0 L working capacity B. Braun M2 culture vessel. Utilities were supplied by a B. Braun Biostat MD that was controlled by a DCU-1. Data acquisition utilized a Dell Optiplex Gs<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>5166M personal computer equipped with B. Braun MFCS/Win software. Temperature, pH, and glucose feeding were controlled with PID control loops. Temperature was maintained at 33&deg; C. pH was maintained at 7.0 by addition of concentrated NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH or 2 N H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. Dissolved oxygen (D.O.) was measured using a Mettler-Toledo 12 mm sterilizable O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor fitted with an Ingold A-type O2 permeable membrane. D.O. was maintained at 10% air saturation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Inoculants were started by introduction of a single colony into 5 mL of M9 medium containing ampicillin. The culture was grown at 37&deg; C. with agitation at 250 rpm for 24 h and subsequently transferred to 100 mL of M9 medium containing ampicillin. After growth at 37&deg; C., 250 rpm for an additional 12 h, the inoculant was ready for transfer into the fermentation vessel. The initial glucose concentration in the fermentation medium was 20 g/L for SP1.1/pKD12.112 runs and 23 g/L for QP1.1/pKD12.112 runs. Three staged methods were used to maintain D.O. levels at 10% air saturation during the course of run. With the airflow at an initial setting of 0.06 L/L/min, D.O. concentration was maintained by increasing the impeller speed from its initial set point of 50 rpm to its preset maximum of 940 rpm. With the impeller constant at 940 rpm, the mass flow controller then maintained D.O. levels by increasing the airflow rate from 0.06 L/L/min to a preset maximum of 1.0 L/L/min. At constant impeller speed and constant airflow rate, D.O. levels were finally maintained at 10% air saturation for the remainder of the fermentation by oxygen sensor-controlled glucose feeding. At the beginning of this stage, D.O. levels fell below 10% air saturation due to residual initial glucose in the medium. This lasted for approximately 1 h before glucose (65% w/v) feeding started. The PID control parameters were set to 0.0 (off) for the derivative control (<highlight><smallcaps>T</smallcaps></highlight><highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>) and 999.9 s (minimum control action) for integral control (<highlight><smallcaps>T</smallcaps></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Samples (10 mL) of fermentation broth were taken at 6 h intervals.

Dry cell weight (g/L) was obtained using a conversion coefficient of 0.43 g/L/OD<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>.

D-Glucose addition was controlled by dissolved O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>concentration and was a critical control parameter during syntheses of shikimic and quinic acids. When dissolved oxygen levels exceeded the set point value indicating decreased microbial metabolism, the rate of D-glucose addition was increased. When dissolved oxygen levels declined below the set point value indicating increased microbial metabolism, the rate of D-glucose addition was decreased. Proportional-integral-derivative control (PID) was used to control the rate of D-glucose addition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> QP1.1/pKD12.112 was cultured for 60 h under fed-batch fermentor conditions at 37&deg; C., pH 7.0, dissolved oxygen at 10% of saturation and an initial glucose concentration of 23 g/L. Extracellular accumulation of quinic acid began in early to mid log phase of microbial growth as represented by the open boxes in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The dry cell weight is represented by the solid line and closed circles. 3-Dehydroquinate was efficiently converted to quinic acid as there was never a build-up of the intermediate (solid bars in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). After 60 hours of cultivation with K<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.1, <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>QP1.1/pKD12.112 synthesized 60 g/L of quinic acid in 23% yield along with only 2.6 g of 3-dehydroquinate. Quinic acid was isolated from the fermentation broth by ion-exchange chromatography on AG1-x8 (acetate form) and Dowex 50 (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>form) columns. Purified quinic acid was obtained by further recrystallization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The yields of quinic acid obtained from culturing of the homologous construct QP1.1/pKD12.112 were significantly greater than those reported for the heterologous construct <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>AB2848aroD/pKD136/pTW8090A. Cultures of QP1.1/pKD12.112 produced approximately 20 g/L of quinic acid after 24 hours and 60 g/L after 60 hours (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). In contrast, <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>AB2848aroD/pKD136/pTW8090A only produced 10.7 g/L of quinic acid after 24 hours. U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,236; Draths, K.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Microbial synthesis of quinic acid may supplant isolation of this hydroaromatic from plant sources which has limited its synthetic utility. At the same time, increased availability of quinic acid may portend wider utilization of this hydroaromatic. The theoretical maximum yield of microbial synthesis of quinic acid is 43% from D-glucose. Draths, K. M. et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>117:2395 (1995). Comparison with the yields achieved thus far for microbial synthesis of quinic acid (23%) along with the apparent lack of toxicity of this hydroaromatic towards the microbial biocatalyst, suggest that sizable increases in yields and titers are possible. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Leguminous plants, such as soybeans, are able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere due to a symbiotic relationship between the plants and bacteria which dwell in nodules formed in the roots of the plants. Specifically, soil bacteria that are members of the family Rhizobiaceae, are capable of infecting plants and inducing highly differentiated root nodule structures within which atmospheric nitrogen is reduced to ammonia by the bacteria. The host plant utilizes the ammonia as a source of nitrogen. The symbiotic root nodule bacteria are classified in several separate genera, including Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Sinorhizobium, and Azorhizobium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Legume nodulation by rhizobia exhibits some species specificity. Bradyrhizobium species include the commercially important soybean nodulating strains <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>(i.e., strains USDA110 and 123), promiscuous rhizobia of the cowpea group, and <highlight><italic>B. parasponia </italic></highlight>(formerly <highlight><italic>Parasponia rhizobium</italic></highlight>) which nodulates the non-legume Parasponia, as well as a number of tropical legumes, including cowpea and siratro. The most important agricultural host of <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>is soybean (Glycine max), but this bacterium will nodulate a few other legumes (e.g., cowpea and siratro). Fast growing rhizobia include, among others, <highlight><italic>Rhizobium etli, Sinorhizobium meliloti </italic></highlight>(formerly <highlight><italic>Rhizobium meliloti</italic></highlight>), and <highlight><italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii, </italic></highlight>which nodulate bean, alfalfa, and clover, respectively. These Rhizobium species generally display a narrow host range. However, Rhizobium sp. NGR234 has the ability to nodulate over 100 genera of legumes. <highlight><italic>Sinorhizobiium fredii </italic></highlight>(formerly <highlight><italic>Rhizobium fredii</italic></highlight>), is phylogenetically distinct from <highlight><italic>B. japonicum</italic></highlight>, but has the ability to nodulate <highlight><italic>Glycine soja </italic></highlight>(a wild soybean species), G. max cv. Peking, and a few other soybean cultivars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are currently about 70,000,000 acres of soybean grown in the United States. An inoculant industry exists to sell <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>to farmers for incorporation into the soil during soybean planting. The use of these inoculants is intended to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen fixation. Unfortunately, for most of the United States, inoculation has been shown to be ineffective. Therefore, the inoculant industry remains relatively small (approximately $20-30 million per year). Indeed, at present, inoculation is only recommended for newly planted fields (i.e., those not planted with soybeans previously) and fields that have been out of production for over three years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The primary reason for the inefficiency of soil inoculation is the presence of competing extant <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>in soil. When a field has been producing soybean for more than one season, there is a build up of the <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>populations in soil. These bacteria are highly competitive since they have adapted to their soil environment. Hence, when the inoculant is added, the indigenous soil <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>strains compete and win the battle to nodulate the plant. The result is that, in many cases, less than 1% of the nodules formed on the planted soybean are due to the inoculant added. Therefore, even if a high-yielding <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>strain is used as the inoculant, the farmer does not see the yield increase due to the fact that the inoculant has not found its way into the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the major soybean growing areas of the Midwest, the most competitive population of <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>is that of serogroup 123. If improvement in the nitrogen fixing capacity of the soybean-Bradyrhizobium symbiosis through application of superior strains is to be realized, then the difficult problem of competition from indigenous populations (such as serogroup 123) will have to be solved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Significant efforts have been made to understand and alter the competitiveness of indigenous Bradyrhizobia. For example, attempts to alter soybean nodule occupancy ratios of indigenous versus applied Bradyrhizobia have been reported. However, such alterations were only achieved by using ultra-high, economically infeasible rates of the applied strain. In a seven year study, Dunigan et al. &lsqb;Agron. J. 76: 463-466 (1984)&rsqb; demonstrated that the inoculant strain USDA 110 eventually formed the majority of nodules after high rates of application in the first 2 years (serogroup 123 was not among the indigenous population). However, the tenacious competitive ability of serogroup 123 appears not to be related to numbers per se and when normal rates of inoculant are applied the indigenous serogroup 123 population can still form up to 95% of the nodules on soybean. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The formation of nodules on leguminous plants involves a complex exchange and recognition of diffusible signals between the plant and the bacterial symbiont. A key plant signal are the flavonoids which trigger the induction of the bacterial nodulation genes (Day et al &lsqb;2000&rsqb; In: Prokaryotic Nitrogen Fixation: A Model System for the Analysis of a Biological Process, ed. Triplett, E., Horizon Scientific Press, Norfolk, England, pp 385-414). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Nodulation genes of Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium strains affect the early stages of nodule formation including host-bacterium recognition, infection and nodule development. Wild type strains of Bradyrhizobium species display some variation in these early nodulation steps which is reflected in differences in relative rates of initiation of nodulation and ultimately in differences in competitiveness between strains for nodule occupancy. For example, <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>USDA 123 is believed to be more competitive for nodulation than <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>USDA 110. Strains which initiate infection and nodules earlier will occupy a greater portion of the nodules on a given plant. Improving the competitiveness of a specific Bradyrhizobium is an important part of the development of improved inoculants for legumes. A more effective Bradyrhizobium strain must be able to out-compete the indigenous rhizobia population for nodule occupancy in order for their improved qualities to impact on the inoculated legume. Therefore, there is a significant need for an inoculating composition and/or an inoculating method which would improve competitiveness of a selected inoculant strain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the <highlight><italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</italic></highlight>-soybean symbiosis, several key regulatory components have been identified in the regulation of bacterial nodulation genes. Two of these, i.e., a LysR regulator, NodD<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and a two component regulatory system, NodWV are known to positively activate the <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>nodulation genes in response to the plant produced isoflavonoids, genistein and daidzein. A third regulatory component (i.e., NolA) is a MerR type regulator (Sadowsky et al. &lsqb;1991<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA </italic></highlight>88:637-641) that possesses the unique capacity to exist in three functionally distinct forms (i.e., NolA<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, NolA<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and NolA<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) (Loh et al. &lsqb;1999<highlight><italic>&rsqb; J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>181:1544-1554). These polypeptides are derived from alternative translation of three in-frame initiation codons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Induction of the <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>nola gene leads to the subsequent repression of the nodulation genes in this bacterium. The products of the nodulation genes are required for soybean nodulation. Thus, these plant compounds, by inducing nolA expression, lead eventually to an inhibition of nodulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> NolA, is required for the expression of both NolA<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and NolA<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Two transcriptional (P1 and P2) start sites have been identified (Loh et al. &lsqb;1999<highlight><italic>&rsqb; J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>181:1544-1554). Transcription from P1 results in the formation of an mRNA encoding NolA<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. NolA<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>then regulates transcription from P2, resulting in the expression of both NolA<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and NolA<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Although NolA is involved in the negative control of the nodulation genes (Dockendorff, T. C., J. Sanjuan, P. Grob, and G. Stacey &lsqb;1994<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Mol. Plant</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Microbe Interact. </italic></highlight>7:596-602), current information suggests that NolA does not act directly to repress nod gene expression. This view is supported by the observation that while expression of NolA from a multicopy plasmid resulted in a reduction of nod gene expression, interposon mutations to the nolA gene did not lead to elevated levels of nod gene expression (Garcia, M. L., J. Dunlap, J. Loh, and G. Stacey &lsqb;1996<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Mol. Plant-Microbe interact </italic></highlight>9:625-635). In fact, NolA appears to positively regulate the expression of NodD<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the latter of which has been shown to be a repressor of the nod genes in Rhizobium spp. NGR234, Bradyrhizobium spp. (Arach is) NC92 and <highlight><italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum </italic></highlight>(Garcia, M. L., J. Dunlap, J. Loh, and G. Stacey &lsqb;1996<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Mol. Plant</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Microbe Interact </italic></highlight>9:625-635; Gillette, W. K. and G. H. Elkan &lsqb;1996<highlight><italic>&rsqb; J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>178:2757-2766; and Fellay, R., M. Hanin, G. Montorzi, J. Frey, C. Freiberg, W. Golinowski et al. &lsqb;1998<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Mol. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>27:1039-1050. Therefore, NolA affects repression indirectly, through the control of nodD<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Cell-cell signaling plays a large role in the ability of bacteria to respond and adapt to a particular environment. Regulatory systems that control gene expression in response to population density (i.e., quorum sensing) govern such bacterial phenotypes as bioluminescence, antibiotic production, plasmid conjugal transfer and the synthesis of virulence factors in both plant and animal pathogens (Hardman, A. M. et al. &lsqb;1998<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Antonie van Leeuwenhoek </italic></highlight>74:199-210). Quorum sensing involves the recognition of self-produced signal compounds, which function to regulate the expression of genes when threshold levels of these signals have accumulated in cultures of a sufficiently high population density. In Gram-negative bacteria, the best studied of these signals are N-Acyl homoserine-lactones (AHL) (Fuqua, W. C. et al. &lsqb;1994<highlight><italic>&rsqb; J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>176:269-275). In Gram-positive bacteria, an equivalent role is played by various posttranslationally-modified peptides (Kleerebezem, M. et al. &lsqb;1997<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Mol. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>24:895-904). Several AHL compounds have been identified from rhizobia, including <highlight><italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum </italic></highlight>biovars <highlight><italic>viciae, trifolii </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>phaseoli, Rhizobium etli</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><italic>Rhizobium meliloti </italic></highlight>(Thome and Williams &lsqb;1999<highlight><italic>&rsqb; J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>181:981-990; Cha et al. &lsqb;1998<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Mol. Plant Microbe Int. </italic></highlight>11:1119-1129; Gray et al. &lsqb;1996<highlight><italic>&rsqb; J. Bacterial. </italic></highlight>178:372-376; Rosemeyer et al. &lsqb;1998<highlight><italic>&rsqb; J.

In a few cases, these autoinducers have been implicated in the nodulation process. For example, the small AHL molecule produced by <highlight><italic>R. leguminosarum </italic></highlight>bv. <highlight><italic>viciae </italic></highlight>is required for the expression of the rhiABC operon, which is important for rhizosphere growth and nodulation efficiency (Cubo et al. &lsqb;1992<highlight><italic>&rsqb; J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>174:4026-4035). In <highlight><italic>R. etli, </italic></highlight>mutations that disrupt AHL synthesis resulted in decreased nodule numbers on host plants (Rosemeyer et al. &lsqb;1998<highlight><italic>&rsqb; J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>180:815-821). Therefore, AHL-mediated quorum sensing may play an important role in the symbiotic process. To date, no quorum-sensing compound has been identified from the soybean symbiont <highlight><italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The current invention addresses the inefficiency of soil inoculation due to the presence of competing indigenous <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>in soil and provides novel compounds and compositions which increase the efficiency of nodulation in target plants.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The subject invention provides materials and methods for promoting the growth of leguminous plants by enhancing the efficiency of root nodulation by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This enhancement of nodulation efficiency is achieved by providing high-performing inoculant bacteria with a competitive advantage over indigenous bacteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Although indigenous bacteria are typically excellent competitors for forming root nodules, they are typically less efficient at nitrogen-fixation than inoculant bacteria. Therefore, in order for the inoculant bacteria to be capable of exerting their excellent nitrogen-fixing effects, they must first be able to out-compete the indigenous bacteria in order to form root nodules. Advantageously, the subject invention provides materials and methods which enable the inoculant bacteria to establish root nodules, even in the presence of indigenous bacteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention provides isolated novel compounds which induce transcription of the nolA gene. These compounds are, collectively, referred to as nolA inducers. In soybean extracts, HPLC analysis of the compounds revealed at least two active compounds, referred to herein as IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IND-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been identified as phthalic acid bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl) ester and is able to induce nolA. IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been identified as a contaminant of solvents used in the extraction process; however, phthalic acid bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl) ester is a potent inducer of nolA. IND-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a plant-produced NolA inducer that can be isolated according to the methods disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In addition to the plant-derived NolA inducers, the instant invention also provides isolated novel compounds produced by <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>which induce nolA expression. These novel compounds may also be referred to as bacterial nolA inducers. The bacterial nolA inducer appears to be produced in a density-dependent manner in batch culture and may be referred to as a &ldquo;quorum sensing&rdquo; molecule or cell density factor (CDF). Quorum sensing molecules regulate the expression of genes, such as nolA, in response to bacterial population density. The bacterial nolA inducer is insensitive to heat treatment and appears to have a molecular weight of less than 3,000 Da. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Compositions comprising one or more nolA inducers and a carrier are also taught according to the subject invention. NolA inducers include chemical compounds, plant-derived NolA inducers, and bacterial-derived NolA inducers. By way of example, compositions having a NolA inducer include commercially available soybean phosphatidyl inositol extracts, conditioned medium obtained from cultured <highlight><italic>B. japonicum</italic></highlight>, commercially available soybean extracts, or compositions having IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (or isomers, analogs, or homologs thereof), IND-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, or CDF. The compositions may, optionally, include one or more nolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>mutants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Carriers useful in formulation of the compositions of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art and include those described in detail in a number of sources which are well known and readily available to those skilled in the art. Also contemplated as carriers are agricultural materials such as soil additives. Non-limiting examples of such additives include peat, soil conditioners, chemical fertilizers, and organic fertilizers (such as chicken or cow manure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides bacterial cells which are insensitive to the effects of the nolA inducers. These bacterial cells are referred to as NolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>mutants. An exemplary nolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>mutant has been isolated and will be deposited with the American Type Tissue Culture &lsqb;10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Other NolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>mutants include bacterial cells in which the gene or genes encoding the nolA inducer has been inactivated. Inactivation of the gene or genes encoding nolA inducers may be accomplished by deletion of all, or a portion, of the gene or genes encoding the nolA inducer, insertion of nucleic acid sequences within gene or genes encoding the nolA inducer or inactivation of transcriptional control sequences operably linked to nolA inducers. Alternatively, the nolA inducer gene may be inactivated by mutation or deletion of ribosome binding sites. Mutation or deletion of translation initiation sites may also be used to inactivate the nolA gene. Methods of site directed mutagenesis in Gram negative bacteria, such as Rhizobia, are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> NolA insensitive strains can be isolated using a variety of selection procedures. For example, since NolA inducers inhibit nodulation, one can select for NolA insensitive <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>mutants by inoculating plants with a mutated population in the presence of the NolA inducer (e.g., IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IND-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, or CDF, or quorum sensing factor). Bacteria isolated from nodules that form rapidly on the soybean roots would be presumptive mutants that were insensitive to the inhibitory effects of the nolA inducers. These mutants could then be confirmed by directly testing the ability of the inducers to activating transcription of nolA (e.g., using either Northern hybridization or measuring nolA-lacZ expression). Similarly, since nolA expression increases with culture age, plating of mutated <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>cells (containing the nolA-lacZ fusion) on medium containing X-GAL (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-&bgr;-D-galactoside) allows one to distinguish the blue, NolA expressing, and white, NolA non-expressing, cells. This system has been used to isolate and select mutants that are insensitive to the quorum sensing inducer that is expressed in the colonies after prolonged growth (i.e., cells remaining white). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> This same selection scheme can also be used to isolate <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>mutants that lack the ability to produce quorum sensing factor. These mutants should also appear white after prolonged growth. These mutants can also be selected by plating a mutated population of <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>and then overlaying these colonies with soft agar (0.4%) containing a <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>strain with the nolA-lacZ fusion and X-GAL. Mutants defective in production of the quorum sensing factor will not induce the nolA-lacZ fusion in the overlay, while those still producing the factor will rapidly induce the fusion resulting in a blue color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The subject invention advantageously provides methods of increasing nitrogen fixation in plants by applying a nodulation inoculant having NolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>mutants and one or more nolA inducers to plants. In a preferred embodiment, the plants are legumes; in a more preferred embodiment, the plants are soybeans. The inoculant contains NolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>mutants in amounts effective to induce nodulation in the plant and amounts of one or more nolA inducers sufficient to induce the activity of the nolA gene. Methods of preparing inoculants, or coating seeds with inoculants, suitable for use in the present invention are well known in the art and include those taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4, 535,061, 5,173,424, 5,695,541, and 5,916,029 hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The subject invention also provides methods of producing a nodulation inoculant containing reduced amounts of quorum factor (CDF). These improved nodulation inoculants are produced by adding iron to cultures containing nodulating bacterial cells. As used herein, a nodulation inoculant includes any bacterial species that nodulates a plants. Nodulation inoculants produced according to these methods contain lower amounts of quorum factor (CDF) as compared to nodulation inoculants not grown in the presence of iron, and are able to more efficiently nodulate target plant species (as compared to indigenous nodulating bacterial cells or nodulation inoculants not grown in the presence of iron). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The subject invention further provides methods of reducing the production of cell density factor or quorum factor in a nodulation inoculant or a method of increasing the nodulation efficiency of a nodulation inoculant comprising the addition of iron to medium containing the nodulation inoculant. Iron is added in amounts sufficient to suppress the production of cell density factor or quorum factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the above-identified methods, the iron is in the form of compounds containing Fe<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight>. One embodiment provides iron in the form of FeCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. As would be apparent to one skilled in the art, nodulation inoculants can be prepared by culturing the bacterial cells in any size container. For example, the cells can be cultured in a fermenter, batch cultured, cultured on solid medium, cultured in standard culture flasks, or cultured in test tubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments, iron is added to the culture medium at various stages of bacterial growth in amounts sufficient to suppress the production of CDF or quorum factor. Thus, iron can be added to nodulation inoculants in lag, early exponential, exponential, late exponential, early stationary, or stationary growth phase. In other embodiments, the iron can be added to the culture medium prior to the addition of an inoculant starter culture; alternatively, iron can be added to the starter culture and this admixture then added to the culture medium. Iron can also be added to the culture medium and the starter culture. Various embodiments of the invention provide for the addition of at least about 0.05 &mgr;M or at least about 0.1 &mgr;M of iron. Other embodiments provide for the addition of iron in concentrations of at least about 1 &mgr;M, 10 &mgr;M, 100 &mgr;M, or at least about 1 mM. Iron concentrations that ranges from 0.5 &mgr;M to 1M can be also be used in the practice of the instant invention. In some embodiments, the iron has a concentration that ranges from 1 &mgr;M to 500 mM. Other embodiments provide iron concentrations that range from 10 &mgr;M to 250 mM or from 100 &mgr;M to 100 mM. Alternatively, iron can be added in a range of 500 &mgr;M to 50 mM, 750 &mgr;M to 5 mM, or about 1 mM. Each of these ranges is to be construed as providing written support of an iron concentration ranges falling within the range. For example, the range of 100 &mgr;M to 100 mM is also to be construed as providing written support for a ranges such as 300 &mgr;M to 50 mM, 400 &mgr;M to 10 mM, or 500 &mgr;M to 1 mM. Furthermore, as would be apparent to the skilled artisan, aseptic or sterile techniques can be utilized in the practice of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the nodulation inoculant comprises a single species or strain of nodulating bacteria. Other embodiments provide for the combination of different species of nodulating bacteria. Thus, combination of at least two different species of nodulating bacteria can be used in the practice of the disclosed inventions. In some embodiments, the nodulating bacteria is one or more species or strain of Bradyrhizobium. Other non-limiting examples of inoculants that can be produced according to the instant invention include <highlight><italic>Parasponia rhizobium </italic></highlight>(now identified as <highlight><italic>B. parasponia</italic></highlight>), <highlight><italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum </italic></highlight>biovars <highlight><italic>viciae, trifolii </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>phaseoli, </italic></highlight>Rhizobium sp.

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The subject invention also provides for methods of screening organisms or extracts for the production of IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IND-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, CDF (quorum factor), or CDF-like molecules. In this method, extracts or culture supernatants are analyzed for their ability to modulate nolA-lacZ, nodY-lacZ, nodC-lacZ, or nodD-lacZ fusions in transformed host cells. For example, where such molecules are present in the extract or supernatant, nolA expression is induced. In contrast, very little induction is observed with samples where no IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IND-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, CDF (quorum factor), or CDF-like molecules are present. Conditioned medium from organisms to be tested for the presence of CDF or CDF-like molecules can also be used in the subject screening methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the subject invention relates to polynucleotides encoding nolA inducers of the subject invention. The polynucleotide sequence encoding the nolA inducers may, optionally, be operably linked to transcriptional control sequences. As is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the disclosed inducers may be encoded by multiple polynucleotide sequences because of the redundancy of the genetic code. It is well within the skill of a person trained in the art to create these alternative DNA sequences encoding the same, or essentially the same, proteins. As used herein, reference to &ldquo;essentially the same&rdquo; sequence refers to sequences which have amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or insertions which do not materially affect biological activity of the inducers of the invention (namely the ability to induce nolA). Fragments of the inducers which retain the ability to induce nolA expression are also included in this definition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides of the subject invention include vectors and expression cassettes. The vectors and expression cassettes may contain transcriptional control sequences which are operably linked to polynucleotide sequences encoding the nolA inducers of the instant invention. The vectors and expression cassettes of the invention may further include selectable markers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The subject invention also provides transformed plant cells and transgenic plants which have one or more polynucleotide sequences which encode plant-derived or bacterial-derived nolA inducers. The polynucleotide sequences encode compounds which induce the expression of nolA, thereby reducing nodulation in plants by susceptible bacteria. Methods of transforming cells with polynucleotide sequences, vectors, or expression cassettes which encode nolA are well known to those skilled in the art. Plants and plant cells may be transformed by, for example, electroporation, Agrobacterium transformation, engineered plant virus replicons, electrophoresis, microinjection, micro-projectile bombardment, micro-LASER beam-induced perforation of cell wall, or simply by incubation with or without polyethylene glycol (PEG). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The method of increasing nitrogen fixation in plants, to which the NolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>mutants are applied, may be practiced in transgenic plants which express the nolA inducer and non-transgenic plants which constitutively express the NolA inducer; this method may involve the application of compositions having NolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>mutants (bacterial cells) directly to the roots of transgenic plants having polynucleotides encoding a NolA inducer. The compositions having NolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>mutants may, optionally, further include one or more NolA inducers. In one embodiment, the roots may be wounded to enable the NolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>bacterial cells to penetrate the roots more quickly and easily; however, wounding of the roots is not required. In a preferred embodiment, the plants are legumes. More preferably, the plants are soybeans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides methods of reducing or inhibiting the nodulation activity of indigenous <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>by adding a composition having one or more NolA inducers of the invention to soil. In this aspect of the invention, NolA<highlight><superscript>INS </superscript></highlight>bacterial cells may, optionally, be included in the composition. The soil to which these compositions are added include active and fallow fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> To facilitate understanding of the invention, a number of terms are defined below. All publications, patents and patent applications cited herein, whether supra or infra, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety to the extent that the reference is not inconsistent with the teachings provided herein. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &ldquo;a,&rdquo; &ldquo;an&rdquo; and &ldquo;the&rdquo; include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;transgenic plants&rdquo; refers to plants (monocots or dicots), having plant cells in which heterologous polynucleotides, such as those encoding plant or bacterial nolA inducers, are expressed as the result of manipulation by the hand of man. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;peptide&rdquo; refers to a polymer of amino acids and does not refer to a specific-length of the product; thus, polypeptides, oligopeptides, and proteins are included within the definition of peptide. This term also does not refer to, or exclude, post expression modifications of the peptide, for example, glycosylations, acetylations, phosphorylations and the like. Included within the definition are, for example, peptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), polypeptides with substituted linkages, as well as other modifications known in the art, both naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;purified&rdquo; and &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; indicate that the molecule is present in the substantial absence of other molecules of the same type. The term &ldquo;purified&rdquo; as used herein preferably means at least 75% by weight, more preferably at least 85% by weight, more preferably still at least 95% by weight, and most preferably at least 98% by weight, of molecules of the same type are present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;purified&rdquo; and &ldquo;isolated&rdquo;, when referring to a polynucleotide, nucleotide, or nucleic acid, indicate a nucleic acid the structure of which is not identical to that of any naturally occurring nucleic acid or to that of any fragment of a naturally occurring genomic nucleic acid spanning more than three separate genes. The term therefore covers, for example, (a) a DNA which has the sequence of part of a naturally occurring genomic DNA molecules but is not flanked by both of the coding or non-coding sequences that flank that part of the molecule in the genome of the organism in which it naturally occurs (e.g., DNA excised with a restriction enzyme); (b) a nucleic acid incorporated into a vector or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote in a manner such that the resulting molecule is not identical to any naturally occurring vector or genomic DNA; (c) a separate molecule such as a cDNA, a genomic fragment, a fragment produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or a restriction fragment; and (d) a recombinant nucleotide sequence that is part of a hybrid gene, i.e., a gene encoding a fusion protein. Specifically excluded from this definition are nucleic acids present in mixtures of (i) DNA molecules, (ii) transfected cells, and (iii) cell clones, e.g., as these occur in a DNA library such as a cDNA or genomic DNA library. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;polynucleotide&rdquo; as used herein refers to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides. This term refers only to the primary structure of the molecule and thus includes double- and single-stranded DNA and RNA. It also includes known types of modifications, for example, labels which are known in the art, methylation, &ldquo;caps&rdquo;, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, intemucleotide modifications, such as those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as proteins (including for e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmnodified forms of the polynucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Operably linked&rdquo; refers to a juxtaposition wherein the components so described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A control sequence &ldquo;operably linked&rdquo; to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;expression cassette&rdquo; refers to a molecule comprising at least one coding sequence operably linked to a control sequence which includes all nucleotide sequences required for the transcription of cloned copies of the coding sequence and the translation of the mRNAs in an appropriate host cell. Expression cassettes can include, but are not limited to, cloning vectors, specifically designed plasmids, viruses or virus particles. The cassettes may further include an origin of replication for autonomous replication in host cells, selectable markers, various restriction sites, a potential for high copy number and strong promoters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;vector&rdquo; is meant any genetic element, such as a plasmid, phage, transposon, cosmid, chromosome, virus etc., which is capable of replication when associated with the proper control elements and which can transfer gene sequences between cells. Thus, the term includes cloning and expression vehicles, as well as viral vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In order to provide a means of selecting transformed plant or bacterial cells, the vectors for transformation will typically contain a selectable marker gene. Marker genes are expressible DNA sequences which express a polypeptide which resists a natural inhibition by, attenuates, or inactivates a selective substance. Examples of such substances include antibiotics and, in the case of plant cells, herbicides. Suitable marker genes for use in this invention are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It is also contemplated that a particular amino acid sequence of NolA may be encoded by more than one polynucleotide sequence. It may be advantageous to produce nucleotide sequences possessing a substantially different codon usage. Codons can be selected to increase the rate at which expression of the peptide occurs in a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression host in accordance with the frequency with which particular codons are utilized by the host. Other reasons for substantially altering the nucleotide sequence without altering the encoded amino acid sequence include the production of RNA transcripts having more desirable properties, such as a longer half-life, than transcripts produced from the naturally occurring sequence. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> While many of the nodulation genes of <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>are induced by the plant flavonoids genistein and daidzein, these compounds and a variety of other flavonoids failed to induced nolA expression. NolA expression was, however, induced by plant extracts. Analysis of these extracts, using Reverse Phase HPLC, have identified the presence of two distinct compounds (IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IND-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) that are capable of inducing nolA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been identified as a phthalic acid bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl) ester (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). To confirm the activity of this compound, phthalic acid bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl) ester was chemically synthesized and shown to be able of inducing nolA expression (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). This compound is a strong inducer of NolA expression and inhibits nodulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Initial analysis of IND-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> indicates that its activity is sensitive to chitinase treatment. IND-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may also be purified from soybean extracts, particularly commercially available soybean phosphatidylinositol extracts (available from companies such as Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). When tested, the commercially available phosphatidylinositol soybean extracts (Sigma) were found to be capable of inducing nola expression (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Moreover, these extracts were also sensitive to chitinase treatment. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B, we have identified a peak (i.e. peak <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) after Reverse Phase HPLC, that is both capable of inducing nola and sensitive to chitinase. Materials containing IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IND-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> were applied to a C18 column (Phenomenex, Inc., Torrance, Calif.) and eluted with a methanol gradient (0-100%) at a flow rate of 1 mL per minute. </paragraph>

To determine if the bacterial nolA inducer was present in commercial inoculant, three soybean inoculants from two commercially available sources were extracted with butanol, and these extracts analyzed for their ability to induce the nolA-lacZ fusions. As shown in Table 1, nolA expression was induced significantly by the <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>inoculant extracts.

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Quorum control mechanism for NolA induction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> NolA expression is population density dependent; its expression is low at a low population density, and significantly higher in more dense cultures (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). This quorum control of NolA expression appears to be regulated by a compound that is secreted and accumulates in the culture medium. Addition of this compound (i.e. conditioned medium) to <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>cultures grown to a low population density greatly increases the expression of nolA (Table 2). Consistent with the fact that nolA regulates nodD<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the levels of nodD<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>expression not only showed a similar population density dependence (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, Table 2), but were also found to be affected by the addition of the NolA inducer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As shown in Tables 2-3 and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>C, an inducer of nolA-lacZ and nodD<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-lacZ expression was detected in conditioned medium from <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>cultures grown to a high population density. This inducer was capable of inducing transcription of both fusions when added to <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>cultures at 10 &mgr;l/ml. The ability of the conditioned medium to induce the nolA fusions was population density dependent with little or no induction of the fusions observed using conditioned medium derived from cultures of A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&lt;0.2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</cross-reference>). Significant induction was observed with conditioned medium from cultures of A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.5, reaching a maximum at A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&gt;1.0. The bacterially derived inducer within the conditioned medium is insensitive to heat. The nolA inducer present in the conditioned medium was lost after dialysis using a membrane with a cutoff at 3 kDa (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Nod gene induction by genistein is population-density dependent. It has been observed that optimal gene expression occurrs at very low population densities (i.e., A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&lt;0.05, Yuen, J. P. -Y. and G. Stacey &lsqb;1996<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Mol. Plant</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Microbe Interact. </italic></highlight>9:424-428). In order to examine this observation in a systematic way, Bj110-573 cells (containing a chromosomally integrated nodC-lacZ fusion, Dockendorff, T. C. et al. &lsqb;1994<highlight><italic>&rsqb; MoL Plant</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Microbe Interact. </italic></highlight>7:596-602) were cultured to various population densities. Aliquots were taken from these cultures, adjusted to specific, initial population densities, and tested for nodC-lacZ induction using a suboptimal level of genistein (0.025 &mgr;M). In each of these experiments, cells were cultured in the presence of the inducer for 5 hours; a time period that previous experiments had indicated resulted in optimal nodC-lacZ expression. This experimental design allowed for the analysis of nodC-lacZ expression as a function both of the inoculum population density and the initial population density of the inducer-treated aliquots. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the inducibility of nod gene expression was highest in samples where the inoculum cultures were grown to low optical population densities. For example, an inoculum culture grown to an A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.068 was significantly more inducible than a culture grown to an A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.852 regardless of the density at which these cells were assayed. Little or no nodC induction was observed with cells harvested at high population densities (e.g., A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;1.62 or 3.22). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A similar dependence on population density was also observed when the levels of nod gene expression were examined relative to the density of the cell suspension treated with inducer. For example, cells harvested at an A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.192 showed very high levels of nodC-lacZ expression when induced at an A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.1 but inducibility was markedly reduced when the same cells were assayed at an A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.3. These results support the notion that the responsiveness of <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>cells to the nod gene inducer, genistein, is affected by culture age, but is more directly related to culture population density. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> nodY-lacZ induction by genistein was highest at a low population density and drastically reduced at high cell cultures. The fact that nola is involved in the negative regulation of the nod genes and that its expression increased in cultures of higher population density, suggested a role for this protein in population density dependent nod gene repression. This view is supported experimentally by the following two results. First, nodY-lacZ expression in a nola mutant was found to be unaffected by population density (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). Moreover, when the population density dependent factor was added to <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>cultures grown to a low population density, the levels of nod gene induction by isoflavonoids were significantly reduced (Table 2). It is, therefore, likely that high population densities coupled with increased nola expression in response to a bacterial quorum factor leads to elevated expression of the repressor NodD<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; this results in negative control of the flavonoid inducible nod genes. </paragraph>

Each seedling was inoculated with 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>cells. Prior to inoculation of the roots, <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>cells were incubated for 1 h with concentrated, conditioned medium that had been sterilized by filtration through a 0.45 &mgr;M filter (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.). The conditioned medium was used at a final concentration of 10 &mgr;l per 1 ml of culture. At the time of inoculation, the location of the root tip was marked on the outside of the plastic growth pouch. Plants were watered with nitrogen free nutrient solution (Wacek and Brill &lsqb;1976<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>15:519-523). At 21 days post-inoculation, the number of nodules on each root both above and below the root tip mark was recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Consistent with the fact that the nodulation genes are critical for effective nodulation, pretreatment of <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>cells with either IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the quorum factor resulted in reduced nodulation efficiency. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, where a delay in nodulation in both IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and quorum factor treated samples, is reflected by an increased number of nodules on both lateral roots as well as below the RT mark (i.e. root tip mark at the time of inoculation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Such a delay in nodulation is significant in light of results presented above that demonstrate that the quorum determinant is also present in commercial preparations used as soybean inoculants. In these inoculants, the levels of quorum factor would be present in sufficient levels to repress any stimulation of the nod genes by plant produced isoflavonoids, thereby reducing the ability of <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>in these inoculants to nodulate the soybean plant. </paragraph>

Both nolA-lacZ and nodD<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-lacZ expression exhibited a basal level of transcription until mid-log phase (A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.5) at which time expression increased to a maximum at a population density of A<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&gt;1.0. The level of nodD<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-lacZ expression in the NolA mutant strain BjB3 (Garcia et al. &lsqb;1996<highlight><italic>&rsqb; Mol. Plant</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Microbe Interact. </italic></highlight>9:625-635) did not increase with population density and remained at background levels throughout the experiment (data not shown). Thus, these data indicate that the level of NolA expression increases with population density resulting in an elevated level of NodD<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>production. As a control, the level of neomycin phosphotransferase (npt-lacZ) production was not affected by population density indicating that the regulation of gene expression was specific for NolA and NodD<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Recombinantly or UV produced mutants </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> We have generated, by recombinant means, mutations in the nwsB gene. The NwsB mutant appears to be defective in the recognition of the quorum signal and we have performed plant tests with the mutant in competition assays with the wild-type bacteria. In these assays, the effect of IND-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (BEHP) on the ability of the NwsB mutant to nodulate soybean in the presence of wild-type bacteria (at different cell ratios) was examined. The NwsB strain should have a competitive advantage due to the lack of nod gene repression since it does not respond to the quorum signal. Nodule occupancy was scored both above (treated area) and below (new root growth) the root tip mark at the time of inoculation. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the addition of BEHP did increase the percentage of nodules that were occupied by the NwsB mutant. These studies were conducted using 25 &mgr;M levels of BEHP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Another means to generate a mutant similar to NwsB is by UV mutagenesis. A commercial strain, such as <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>Bj61A273, is transformed with a conjugative plasmid containing the nolA gene fused to the lacZ gene, encoding &ggr;-galactosidase. The latter is a reporter enzyme that allows the detection of NolA expression by formation of blue color on plates containing the chemical X-Gal. UV treated <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>cells harboring a nolA-lacZ fusion are screened and selected for colonies that remain white on agar containing X-gal and inducing levels of the BEHP. To test whether an NwsB mutant has been isolated, complementation studies with the mutant and the nwsB gene will be conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Alternatively <highlight><italic>B. japonicum </italic></highlight>mutants can be isolated using the soybean plant as the means of selecting strains that are resistant to BEHP (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). UV treated USDA61A2 73 cells were inoculated onto soybean roots in the presence of BEHP. Most of the nodules formed in the UV treated samples demonstrated a delayed nodule phenotype in the presence of BEHP (ie., below the root tip mark at the time of inoculation). Nodules formed above the root tip mark were extracted for bacteria. Single colonies have been isolated and are being re-screened for their ability to nodulate soybean plants in the presence of BEHP. In addition, these colonies are being transformed with the nolA-lacZ plasmid, and will be tested for BEHP mediated nolA-lacZ activity. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to devices containing liquid crystals which are optionally patterned. Also provided are methods of using these devices as sensors. More particularly, the present invention relates to liquid crystal devices for detecting the interaction an analyte to a recognition moiety that is contained within the device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Liquid crystals possess physical properties which are normally associated with both solids and liquids. Similar to fluids, the molecules in liquid crystals are free to diffuse about, however, a small degree of long range orientational and sometimes positional order is maintained, causing the substance to be anisotropic as is typical of solids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A vast array of organic and metal-containing substances exhibit liquid crystallinity. A common feature of these molecules is either an elongated or flattened, somewhat inflexible molecular framework which is usually depicted as either cigar- or disk-shaped. The orientational and positional order in a liquid crystal phase is only partial, with the intermolecular forces striking a very delicate balance between attractive and repulsive forces. As a result, liquid crystals display an extraordinary sensitivity to external perturbations (e.g., temperature, pressure, electric and magnetic fields, shearing stress or foreign vapors). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The phenomenon of orientation, or anchoring, of liquid crystals by surfaces has been known nearly as long as have liquid crystals themselves. Anchoring of a liquid crystal by a surface fixes the mean orientation taken by the molecules with respect to the surface. This fixed direction is called the anchoring direction of the liquid crystal. A liquid population of mesogenic molecules can undergo a transition, between two or more anchoring directions, as a result of an external perturbation. Several anchoring transitions have been observed. These transitions involve a change in the orientation of the liquid crystal in the plane of the substrate which can be continuous or discontinuous. The transitions can be induced by a number of different perturbations, including the adsorption of foreign molecules. Such adsorption modifies the interface between the substrate and the liquid crystal, thereby inducing a &ldquo;switching&rdquo; between anchoring directions. See, Jerome, B; Shen, Y. R., <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. </italic></highlight>E, 48:4556-4574 (1993) and Bechhoefer et al., <highlight><italic>Phase Transitions </italic></highlight>33:227-36 (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Past interest in the orientations assumed by liquid crystals near surfaces has been largely driven by their use in electrooptical devices such as flat-panel displays (FPDs). A goal of many studies has, therefore, been the development of methods for the fabrication of surfaces that uniformly orient liquid crystals over large areas. Future uses of liquid crystals in electrooptic devices, in contrast, will rely increasingly on liquid crystals with patterned orientations over small areas (Gibbons et al. <highlight><italic>Appl. Phys. Lett. </italic></highlight>65:2542 (1994); Bos et al., <highlight><italic>J. Soc. Inf. Disp. </italic></highlight>3-4: 195 (1995); Morris et al., <highlight><italic>Emmel, Proc. Soc. Photo-Opt. Instrum. Eng. </italic></highlight>2650, 112 (1996); Mural et al., ibid., 1665:230 (1992); Patel et al., <highlight><italic>Opt. Lett. </italic></highlight>16:532 (1991); Zhang et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>114:1506 (1992); W. P. Parker, <highlight><italic>Proc. Soc. Photo-Opt. Instrum. Eng. </italic></highlight>2689:195 (1996)). For example, light can be diffracted or redirected by using patterned mesogenic layer structures that are tuned by application of a uniform electric field (W. P. Parker, <highlight><italic>Proc. Soc. Photo-Opt. Instrum. Eng. </italic></highlight>2689:195 (1996)), and FPDs with wide viewing angles and broad gray scales can be fabricated by using pixels that are divided into subpixels, where each sub-pixel is defined by a different orientation of the liquid crystal (Schadt et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>381:212 (1996)). Methods capable of patterning mesogenic layers on curved surfaces are also required for the development of new types of tunable electrooptic mesogenic layer devices, including devices that combine the diffraction of light from the patterned mesogenic layer structure with the refraction of light at the curved surface (Resler et al., <highlight><italic>Opt. Lett. </italic></highlight>21:689 (1996); S. M. Ebstein, <highlight><italic>ibid, </italic></highlight>p.1454; M. B. Stem, <highlight><italic>Microelectron. Eng. </italic></highlight>32:369 (1996): Goto et al., <highlight><italic>Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. </italic></highlight>31:1586 (1992); Magiera et al., <highlight><italic>Soc. PhotoOpt. Instrum. Eng., </italic></highlight>2774:204 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Current procedures for the fabrication of patterned mesogenic layer structures use either spatially nonuniform electric fields from patterned electrodes or patterned &ldquo;anchoring&rdquo; surfaces. Fringing of electric fields from patterned electrodes prevents high-resolution patterning of mesogenic layers by this method (Gibbons et al. <highlight><italic>Appl. Phys. Lett. </italic></highlight>65:2542 (1994); Williams et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Soc. PhotoOpt. Instrum. Eng. </italic></highlight>1168:352 (1989)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Patterned anchoring surfaces have been prepared by using mechanical rubbing of spin-coated polymer films, photolithographic masking, and a second rubbing step performed in a direction orthogonal to the first (Patel et al., <highlight><italic>Opt. Lett. </italic></highlight>16:532 (1991); W. P. Parker, <highlight><italic>Proc. Soc. Photo-Opt. Instrum. Eng. </italic></highlight>2689:195 (1996); Chen et al., <highlight><italic>Appl. Phys. Lett. </italic></highlight>67:2588 (1995)). This method of patterning mesogenic layers on surfaces is complex and suffers from the disadvantages of rubbing-based methods, such as the generation of dust and static charge. Recently developed photo-alignment techniques for orienting mesogenic layers provide promising alternatives (Gibbons et al. <highlight><italic>Appl. Phys. Lett. </italic></highlight>65:2542 (1994); Schadt et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>381:212 (1996); Chen et al., <highlight><italic>Appl. Phys. Lett. </italic></highlight>68:885 (1996); Gibbons et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>351:49 (1991); Gibbons et al., <highlight><italic>ibid. </italic></highlight>377:43 (1995); Shannon et al. 368:532 (1994); Ikeda et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>268:1873 (1995); Schadt et al., <highlight><italic>Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. </italic></highlight>34:3240 (1995)). However, because light-based methods generally require surfaces to be spin-coated by uniformly thin films of photopolymer, and because the orientations of mesogenic layers on photo-aligned surfaces are determined by the angle of incidence of the light used for alignment, these methods are not easily applied to the patterning of mesogenic layers on nonplanar surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention permit fabrication of complex mesogenic layer structures in two simple processing steps. Surfaces can be patterned with regions of mesogenic layers that differ in shape and have sizes ranging from micrometers to centimeters. The mesogenic layers can also be patterned on nonplanar surfaces (mesogenic layers have been anchored within pores of alumina and vycor glass coated with surface-active reagents, Crawford. et al. <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. E </italic></highlight>53:3647 (1996), and references therein). The present invention differs from this past work in two principal ways. (i) Scale: Mesogenic layers have been anchored on curved surfaces with radii of curvature that are large compared with the thickness of the mesogenic layer. The local state of the mesogenic layer is similar to that of mesogenic layers anchored on a planar surface and thus properties of the mesogenic layer are not dominated by elastic energies caused by curvature. Methodologies used for anchoring mesogenic layers on planar surfaces (for example, twisted nematic cells) can be translated to our curved surfaces; and (ii) Patterns: The methods of the invention allow the formation of patterned curved surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Self-assembled monolayers formed by the chemisorption of alkanethiols on gold are likely to now be the most intensively characterized synthetic organic monolayers prepared to date. See, Ulman, A., 1991<highlight><italic>, An Introduction to Ultrathin Organic Films: From Langmuir-Blodgett to Self Assembly </italic></highlight>(San Diego, Calif.: Academic Press); Dubois, L. H. et al., 1992<highlight><italic>, Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem., </italic></highlight>43, 437. These monolayers form spontaneously during immersion of evaporated films of gold in solutions of alkanethiols as a result of chemisorption of sulfur on the (111) textured surface of the films. The molecules self-organize into a commensurate <highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>3&times;<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>3R30&deg; lattice on the surface of the Au(111). See, &ldquo;Porter, M. D. 1987<highlight><italic>, J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>109, 3559; Camillone III, N. et al., 1993<highlight><italic>, Chem. Phys., </italic></highlight>98, 3503; Fenter, P. et al., 1994<highlight><italic>, Science, </italic></highlight>266, 1216; 20; Chidsey, C. E. D. et al., 1990<highlight><italic>, Langmuir, </italic></highlight>6, 682; Sun, F.; Mao, G.; Grainger, D. W. et al., 1994<highlight><italic>, Thin Solid Films, </italic></highlight>242, 106. For monolayers formed from CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>SH, n&gt;9, at least, the aliphatic chains of the monolayers are extended in the all-trans conformation and tilted approximately 30&deg; from the normal of the surface. Because the spacing between sulfur groups on the <highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>3&times;<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>3R30&deg; lattice is, on average, 4.9 &angst;, whereas the van der Waals diameter of an aliphatic chains is only &tilde;4 &angst;, the aliphatic chains within these SAMs tilt from the normal so as to come into van der Waals contact and thereby maximize their cohesive dispersive interactions. Studies of the lateral structure within monolayers using X-ray diffraction reveal the existence of domains of size &tilde;100 &angst;, where each domain has one of six different tilt directions relative to the Au(111) face. See, Fenter, P. et al., 1994<highlight><italic>, Science, </italic></highlight>266, 1216.; Recent studies have shown the existence a c(4&times;2) superlattice, the cause of which remains unresolved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Surfaces prepared by the chemisorption of organosulfur compounds on evaporated films of gold are not limited to the alkanethiols. Self-assembled monolayers formed from perfluorinated organosulfur compounds have also been reported. See, Lenk, T. J, et al. 1994<highlight><italic>, Langmuir, </italic></highlight>10, 4610.; Drawhom, R. A. et al., 1995<highlight><italic>, J. Phys. Chem., </italic></highlight>99, 16511. These surfaces, too, can be highly ordered, although, interestingly, the origin of the order within the monolayer is largely intramolecular and contrasts, therefore, to monolayers formed from alkanethiols (where the order largely reflects the cohesive intermolecular dispersion force). Steric interactions between adjacent fluorine atoms of a perfluorinated chain cause the chain to twists itself into a rigid, helical conformation. That is, an isolated perfluoro chain is stiff, as compared to an aliphatic chain. Because perfluorinated chains have larger cross-sectional areas than alkanethiols, monolayers formed on gold from perfluorinated thiols are not tilted from the normal to the same degree as alkanethiols. See, Drawhorn, R. A. et al., 1995<highlight><italic>, J. Phys. Chem., </italic></highlight>99, 16511. Estimates by IR studies place the tilt of the perfluorinated chains at 0&tilde;10&deg;. Because perfluorinated chains within SAMs on Au(111) are not tilted to the same degree as the alkanethiols, their surfaces are not expected to possess domains formed from regions of monolayer with different tilt directions (as occurs with monolayers formed from alkanethiols). Past reports do not describe the anchoring of liquid crystals on densely-packed monolayers formed from semifluorinated chains. Past investigations on fluorocarbon surfaces have focused on surfaces coated with films of fluorinated polymers such as poly-(tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon&trade;) and poly-(vinylidene fluoride) (Tedlar&trade;), or fluorine containing surface reagents that pack loosely and host polar/charged groups. See, Cognard, J., 1982<highlight><italic>, Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. Supp., </italic></highlight>78, 1; Uchida, T. et al., 1992<highlight><italic>, Liquid Crystals Applications and Uses, </italic></highlight>edited by Bahadur, B. (New Jersey: World Scientific), p.2; Hoffman, C. L.; Tsao, M.-W; Rabolt, J. F.; Johnson, H. et al., unpublished results. Due to differences in the method of preparation (e.g., plasma polymerization of teflon vs. sliding contact of a teflon block) results reported in the past for the anchoring of liquid crystals on fluorinated surfaces are variable. In general, however, the fluorocarbon surface, which is a low energy surface, is reported to cause homeotropic anchoring. See, Uchida, T. et al., 1992<highlight><italic>, Liquid Crystals Applications and Uses</italic></highlight>, edited by Bahadur, B. (New Jersey: World Scientific), p.2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The use of self-assembled monolayers formed from noon-fluorinated, semifluorinated and perfluorinated organosulfur compounds permits the preparation of well-defined fluorocarbon surfaces for the anchoring mesogenic layers. Mesogenic layers anchored onto these well-defined surfaces are sensitive to perturbations caused from a wide range of sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Numerous practical applications of the mesogenic layer&apos;s sensitivity to perturbation have been realized. For example, liquid crystals have been used as temperature sensors (U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,828, issued to Fergason on Jul. 14, 1992). Devices containing liquid crystal components have also been used as sensors for indicating the concentration of ethylene oxide in the workplace (U.S. Pat. No. 4,597,942, issued to Meathrel on Jul. 1, 1986). Meathral teaches a device which has an absorbent layer on top of a paper substrate. Neither Meathral not Fergason teach the switchable anchoring of liquid crystals on self-assembled monolayers. Additional information on the use of liquid crystals as vapor sensors is available in Poziomek et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst., </italic></highlight>27:175-185 (1973). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Liquid crystal devices which undergo anchoring transitions as a result of protein-ligand binding have been reported by Gupta, V. K., Abbott, N. L., Science 276:1533-1536 (1998). Switchable liquid crystals supported on self-assembled monolayers were used to detect the binding of avidin and goat-anti-biotin to a biotinylated self-assembled monolayer. Biotin exhibits a very specific, high affinity binding to both avidin (Kd&tilde;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;15</superscript></highlight>) and anti-biotin (Kd&tilde;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9</superscript></highlight>). Gupta et al. teaches the binding of biotin to the self-assembled monolayer and the interaction of this ligand with proteins which are known to display specific and strong binding to biotin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> There is a recognized need in the chemical and pharmaceutical arts for devices having patterned liquid crystals as a component thereof. Further, there is a need for a facile method to produce such patterned liquid crystals. In addition, there is a long recognized need for both methods and devices to detect and characterize analytes in a simple, inexpensive and reliable manner. Even more desirable are systems that can detect the specific interaction of an analyte with another molecule. A device having a detection spatial resolution on approximately the micrometer scale would prove ideal for numerous applications including the synthesis and analysis of combinatorial libraries of compounds. If detecting molecular interactions could be accomplished without the need for prelabeling the analyte with, for example a radiolabel or a fluorescent moiety, this would represent a significant advancement. Quite surprisingly, the present invention provides such devices and methods. </paragraph>

The crystals and glasses can be prepared by art standard techniques. See, for example, Goodman, C. H. L., Crystal Growth Theory and Techniques, Plenum Press, New York 1974. Alternatively, the crystals can be purchased commercially (e.g., Fischer Scientific). The crystals can be the sole component of the substrate or they can be coated with one or more additional substrate components. Thus, it is within the scope of the present invention to utilize crystals coated with, for example one or more metal films or a metal film and an organic polymer. Additionally, a crystal can constitute a portion of a substrate which contacts another portion of the substrate made of a different material, or a different physical form (e.g., a glass) of the same material.

<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> A.2 Inorganic Oxides </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Inorganic oxides can also form a substrate of the device of the present invention.

The inorganic oxides can be utilized in a variety of physical forms such as films, supported powders, glasses, crystals and the like.

<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> A.3 Metals </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Metals are also of use as susbstrates in the present invention. The metal can be used as a crystal, a sheet or a powder. The metal can be deposited onto a backing by any method known to those of skill in the art including, but not limited to, evaporative deposition, sputtering and electroless deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Any metal that is chemically inert towards the mesogenic layer will be useful as a substrate in the present invention. Metals that are presently preferred as substrates include, but are not limited to, gold, silver, platinum, palladium, nickel and copper. In one embodiment, more than one metal is used. The more than one metal can be present as an alloy or they can be formed into a layered &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; structure, or they can be laterally adjacent to one another. In a preferred embodiment, the metal used for the substrate is gold. In a particularly preferred embodiment the metal used is gold layered on titanium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The metal layers can be either permeable or impermeable to materials such as liquids, solutions, vapors and gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> A.4 Organic Polymers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Organic polymers are a useful class of substrate materials. Organic polymers useful as substrates in the present invention include polymers which are permeable to gases, liquids and molecules in solution. Other useful polymers are those which are impermeable to one or more of these same classes of compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Organic polymers that form useful substrates include, for example, polyalkenes (e.g., polyethylene, polyisobutene, polybutadiene), polyacrylics (e.g., polyacrylate, polymethyl methacrylate, polycyanoacrylate), polyvinyls (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl chloride), polystyrenes, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides, polyimides, polysulfone, polysiloxanes, polyheterocycles, cellulose derivative (e.g., methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, nitrocellulose), polysilanes, fluorinated polymers, epoxies, polyethers and phenolic resins. See, Cognard, J. ALIGNMENT OF NEMATIC LIQUID CRYSTALS AND THEIR MIXTURES, in <highlight><italic>Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. </italic></highlight>1:1-74 (1982). Presently preferred organic polymers include polydimethylsiloxane, polyethylene, polyacrylonitrile, cellulosic materials, polycarbonates and polyvinyl pyridinium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In a presently preferred embodiment, the substrate is permeable and it consists of a layer of gold, or gold over titanium, which is deposited on a polymeric membrane, or other material, that is permeable to liquids, vapors and/or gases. The liquids and gases can be pure compounds (e.g., chloroform, carbon monoxide) or they can be compounds which are dispersed in other molecules (e.g., aqueous protein solutions, herbicides in air, alcoholic solutions of small organic molecules). Useful permeable membranes include, but are not limited to, flexible cellulosic materials (e.g., regenerated cellulose dialysis membranes), rigid cellulosic materials (e.g., cellulose ester dialysis membranes), rigid polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, polydimethylsiloxane and track etched polycarbonate membranes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment, the layer of gold on the permeable membrane is itself permeable. In a still further preferred embodiment, the permeable gold layer has a thickness of about 70 &angst; or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In those embodiments wherein the permeability of the substrate is not a concern and a layer of a metal film is used, the film can be as thick as is necessary for a particular application. For example, if the film is used as an electrode, the film can be thicker than in an embodiment in which it is necessary for the film to be transparent or semi-transparent to light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the film is of a thickness of from about 0.01 nanometer to about 1 micrometer. In a further preferred embodiment, the film is of a thickness of from about 5 nanometers to about 100 nanometers. In yet a further preferred embodiment, the film is of a thickness of from about 10 nanometers to about 50 nanometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> A.5 Substrate Surfaces </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The nature of the surface of the substrate has a profound effect on the anchoring of the mesogenic layer which is associated with the surface. The surface can be engineered by the use of mechanical and/or chemical techniques. The surface of each of the above enumerated substrates can be substantially smooth. Alternatively, the surface can be roughened or patterned by rubbing, etching, grooving, stretching, oblique deposition or other similar techniques known to those of skill in the art. Of particular relevance is the texture of the surface which is in contact with the mesogenic compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the substrate is glass or an organic polymer and the surface has been prepared by rubbing. Rubbing can be accomplished using virtually any material including tissues, paper, brushes, polishing paste, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the rubbing is accomplished by use of a diamond rubbing paste. In another preferred embodiment, the face of the substrate that contacts the mesogenic compounds is a metal layer that has been obliquely deposited by evaporation. In a further preferred embodiment, the metal layer is a gold layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The substrate can also be patterned using techniques such as photolithography (Kleinfield et al., <highlight><italic>J. Neurosci. </italic></highlight>8:4098-120 (1998)), photoetching, chemical etching and microcontact printing (Kumar et al., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>10: 1498-511 (1994)). Other techniques for forming patterns on a substrate will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The size and complexity of the pattern on the substrate is limited only by the resolution of the technique utilized and the purpose for which the pattern is intended. For example, using microcontact printing, features as small as 200 nm have been layered onto a substrate. See, Xia, Y.; Whitesides, G., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>117:3274-75 (1995). Similarly, using photolithography, patterns with features as small as 1 &mgr;m have been produced. See, Hickman et al., <highlight><italic>J. Vac. Sci. Technol. </italic></highlight>12:607-16 (1994). Patterns which are useful in the present invention include those which comprise features such as wells, enclosures, partitions, recesses, inlets, outlets, channels, troughs, diffraction gratings and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In a presently preferred embodiment, the patterning is used to produce a substrate having a plurality of adjacent wells, wherein each of the wells is isolated from the other wells by a raised wall or partition and the wells do not fluidically communicate. Thus, an analyte, or other substance, placed in a particular well remains substantially confined to that well. In another preferred embodiment, the patterning allows the creation of channels through the device whereby an analyte can enter and/or exit the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The pattern can be printed directly onto the substrate or, alternatively, a &ldquo;lift off&rdquo; technique can be utilized. In the lift off technique, a patterned resist is laid onto the substrate, an organic layer is laid down in those areas not covered by the resist and the resist is subsequently removed. Resists appropriate for use with the substrates of the present invention are known to those of skill in the art. See, for example, Kleinfield et al., <highlight><italic>J. Neurosci. </italic></highlight>8:4098-120 (1998). Following removal of the photoresist, a second organic layer, having a structure different from the first organic layer can be bonded to the substrate on those areas initially covered by the resist. Using this technique, substrates with-patterns having regions of different chemical characteristics can be produced. Thus, for example, a pattern having an array of adjacent wells can be created by varying the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, charge and other chemical characteristics of the pattern constituents. In one embodiment, hydrophilic compounds can be confined to individual wells by patterning walls using hydrophobic materials. Similarly, positively or negatively charged compounds can be confined to wells having walls made of compounds with charges similar to those of the confined compounds. Similar substrate configurations are accessible through microprinting a layer with the desired characteristics directly onto the substrate. See, Mrkish, M.; Whitesides, G. M., <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biomol Struct. </italic></highlight>25:55-78 (1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In yet another preferred embodiment, the patterned substrate controls the anchoring alignment of the liquid crystal. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the substrate is patterned with an organic compound which forms a self-assembled monolayer. In this embodiment, the organic layer controls the azimuthal orientation and/or polar orientation of a supported mesogenic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> B. Organic Layers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In addition to the ability of a substrate to anchor a mesogenic layer, an organic layer attached to the substrate is similarly able to provide such anchoring. A wide range of organic layers can be used in conjunction with the present invention. These include organic layers formed from organothiols, organosilanes, amphiphilic molecules, cyclodextrins, polyols (e.g., poly(ethyleneglycol), poly(propyleneglycol), fullerenes, and biomolecules. Other useful compounds will be apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> B.1 Anchoring </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> An organic layer that is bound to, supported on or adsorbed onto, the surface of the substrate can anchor a mesogenic layer. As used herein, the term &ldquo;anchoring&rdquo; refers to the set of orientations adopted by the molecules in the mesogenic phase. The mesogenic layer will adopt particular orientations while minimizing the free energy of the interface between the organic layer and the mesogenic layer. The orientation of the mesogenic layer is referred to as an &ldquo;anchoring direction.&rdquo; A number of anchoring directions are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The particular anchoring direction adopted will depend upon the nature of the mesogenic layer, the organic layer and the substrate. Anchoring directions of use in the present invention include, for example, conical anchoring, degenerate anchoring, homeotropic anchoring, multistable anchoring, planar anchoring and tilted anchoring. Planar anchoring and homeotropic anchoring are preferred with homeotropic anchoring being most preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The anchoring of mesogenic compounds by surfaces has been extensively studied for a large number of systems. See, for example, Jerome, B., <highlight><italic>Rep. Prog. Phys. </italic></highlight>54:391-451 (1991). The anchoring of a mesogenic substance by a surface is specified, in general, by the orientation of the director of the bulk phase of the mesogenic layer. The orientation of the director, relative to the surface, is described by a polar angle (measured from the normal of the surface) and an azimuthal angle (measured in the plane of the surface). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Control of the anchoring of mesogens has been largely based on the use of organic surfaces prepared by coating surface-active molecules or polymer films on inorganic (e g., silicon oxide) substrates followed by surface treatments such as rubbing. Other systems which have been found useful include surfaces prepared through the reactions of organosilanes with various substrates. See, for example, Yang et al., In, MICROCHEMISTRY: SPECTROSCOPY AND CHEMISTRY IN SMALL DOMAINS; Masuhara et al., Eds.; North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1994; p.441. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Molecularly designed surfaces formed by organic layers on a substrate can be used to control both the azimuthal and polar orientations of a supported mesogenic layer. SAMs can be patterned on a surface. For example, patterned organic layers made from CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>14</subscript></highlight>SH and CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>SH on obliquely deposited gold produce a supported mesogenic layer which is twisted 90&deg;. Other anchoring modes are readily accessible by varying the chain length and the number of species of the organic layer constituents. See, Gupta, V. K.; Abbott, N. L., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>276:1533-1536 (1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Transitions between anchoring modes have been obtained on a series of organic layers by varying the structure of the organic layer. The structural features which have been found to affect the anchoring of mesogenic compounds include, for example, the density of molecules within the organic layer, the size and shape of the molecules constituting the organic layer and the number of individual layers making up the bulk organic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The density of the organic layer on the substrate has been shown to have an effect on the mode of mesogen anchoring. For example, transitions between homeotropic and degenerate anchorings have been obtained on surfactant monolayers by varying the density of the monolayers. See, Proust et al., Solid State Commun. 11:1227-30 (1972). Thus, it is within the scope of the present invention to tailor the anchoring mode of a mesogen by controlling the density of the organic layer on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The molecular structure, size and shape of the individual molecules making up the organic layer also affects the anchoring mode. For example, it has been demonstrated that varying the length of the aliphatic chains of surfactants on a substrate can also induce anchoring transitions: with long chains, a homeotropic anchoring is obtained while with short chains, a conical anchoring is obtained with the tilt angle &THgr; increasing as the chain becomes shorter. See, for example, Porte, <highlight><italic>J. Physique </italic></highlight>37:1245-52 (1976). Additionally, recent reports have demonstrated that the polar angle of the mesogenic phase can be controlled by the choice of the constituents of the organic layer. See, Gupta, V. K.; Abbott, N. L., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>12:2587-2593 (1996). Thus, it is within the scope of the present invention to engineer the magnitude of the anchoring shift as well as the type of shift by the judicious choice of organic layer constituents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of organic layers are useful in practicing the present invention. These organic layers can comprise monolayers, bilayers and multilayers. Furthermore, the organic layers can be attached by covlaent bonds, ionic bonds, physisorption, chemisorption and the like, including, but not limited to, hydrophobic interactions, hydrophilic interactions, van der Waals interactions and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> In a presently preferred embodiment, organic layers which form self-assembled monolayers are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) formed from alkanethiols on thin, semitransparent films of gold in studies on the anchoring of liquid crystals on surfaces has been reported. See, Drawhorn, R. A.; Abbott, N. L., <highlight><italic>J. Phys. Chem. </italic></highlight>45:16511 (1995). The principal result of that work was the demonstration that SAMs formed from n-alkanethiols with long (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>SH) and short (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>SH or CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>SH) aliphatic chains can homeotropically anchor mesogens. In contrast, single-component SAMs (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>SH, 2&lt;n&gt;15) caused non-uniform, planar, or tilted anchoring at room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In the discussion that follows, self-assembled monolayers are utilized as an exemplary organic layer. This use is not intended to be limiting. It will be understood that the various configurations of the self-assembled monolayers and their methods of synthesis, binding properties and other characteristics are equally applicable to each of the organic layers of use in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> B.2 Self-Assembled Monolayers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Self-assembled monolayers are generally depicted as an assembly of organized, closely packed linear molecules. There are two widely-used methods to deposit molecular monolayers on solid substrates: Langmuir-Blodgett transfer and self-assembly. Additional methods include techniques such as depositing a vapor of the monolayer precursor onto a substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The composition of a layer of a SAM useful in the present invention, can be varied over a wide range of compound structures and molar ratios. In one embodiment, the SAM is formed from only one compound. In a presently preferred embodiment, the SAM is formed from two or more components. In another preferred embodiment, when two or more components are used, one component is a long-chain hydrocarbon having a chain length of between 10 and 25 carbons and a second component is a short-chain hydrocarbon having a chain length of between 1 and 9 carbon atoms. In particularly preferred embodiments, the SAM is formed from CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>SH and CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>SH or CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>SH and CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>SH. In any of the above described embodiments, the carbon chains can be functionalized at the &ohgr;-terminus (e.g., NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, COOH, OH, CN), at internal positions of the chain (e.g., aza, oxa, thia) or at both the &ohgr;-terminus and internal positions of the chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The mesogenic layer can be layered on top of one SAM layer or it can be sandwiched between two SAM layers. In those embodiments in which the mesogenic layer is sandwiched between two SAMs, a second substrate, optionally substantially identical in composition to that bearing the SAM can be layered on top of the mesogenic layer. Alternatively a compositionally different substrate can be layered on top of the mesogenic layer. In a preferred embodiment, the second substrate is permeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In yet another preferred embodiment two substrates are used, but only one of the substrates has an attached organic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> When the mesogenic layer is sandwiched between two layers of SAMs several compositional permutations of the layers of SAMs are available. For example, in one embodiment, the first organic layer and the second organic layer have substantially identical compositions and both of the organic layers bear an attached recognition moiety. A variation on this embodiment utilizes first and second organic layers with substantially similar compositions, wherein only one of the layers bears a recognition moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the first and second organic layers have substantially different compositions and only one of the organic layers has an attached recognition moiety. In a further embodiment, the first organic layer and said second organic layer have substantially different compositions and both of the organic layers have an attached recognition moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> In a presently preferred embodiment, the organic layers have substantially identical compositions and one or both of the organic layers has attached thereto a recognition moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> A recognition moiety can be attached to the surface of a SAM by any of a large number of art-known attachment methods. In one preferred embodiment, a reactive SAM component is attached to the substrate and the recognition moiety is subsequently bound to the SAM component via the reactive group on the component and a group of complementary reactivity on the recognition moiety. See, for example, Hegner et al. <highlight><italic>Biophys. J. </italic></highlight>70:2052-2066 (1996). In another preferred embodiment, the recognition moiety is attached to the SAM component prior to immobilizing the SAM component on the substrate surface: the recognition moiety-SAM component cassette is then attached to the substrate. In a still further preferred embodiment, the recognition moiety is attached to the substrate via a displacement reaction. In this embodiment, the SAM is preformed and then a fraction of the SAM components are displaced by a recognition moiety or a SAM component bearing a recognition moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> B.3 Functionalized SAMs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The discussion which follows focuses on the attachment of a reactive SAM component to the substrate surface. This focus is for convenience only and one of skill in the art will understand that the discussion is equally applicable to embodiments in which the SAM component-recognition moiety is preformed prior to its attachment to the substrate. As used herein, &ldquo;reactive SAM components&rdquo; refers to components which have a functional group available for reaction with a recognition moiety or other species following the attachment of the component to the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Currently favored classes of reactions available with reactive SAM components are those which proceed under relatively mild conditions. These include, but are not limited to nucleophilic substitutions (e.g., reactions of amines and alcohols with acyl halides), electrophilic substitutions (e.g., enamine reactions) and additions to carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds (e.g., Michael reaction, Diels-Alder addition). These and other useful reactions are discussed in March, J., ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, Third Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1985. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a substrate&apos;s surface is functionalized with SAM components and other species by covalently binding a reactive SAM component to the substrate surface in such a way as to derivatize the substrate surface with a plurality of available reactive functional groups. reactive groups which can be used in practicing the present invention include, for example, amines, hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid derivatives, alkenes, sulfhydryls, siloxanes, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of reaction types is available for the functionalization of a substrate surface. For example, substrates constructed of a plastic such as polypropylene, can be surface derivatized by chromic acid oxidation, and subsequently converted to hydroxylated or aminomethylated surfaces. Substrates made from highly crosslinked divinylbenzene can be surface derivatized by chloromethylation and subsequent functional group manipulation. Additionally, functionalized substrates can be made from etched, reduced polytetrafluoroethylene </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> When the substrates are constructed of a siliceous material such as glass, the surface can be derivatized by reacting the surface Si&mdash;OH, SiO&mdash;H, and/or Si&mdash;Si groups with a functionalizing reagent. When the substrate is made of a metal film, the surface can be derivatized with a material displaying avidity for that metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, wherein the substrates are made from glass, the covalent bonding of the reactive group to the glass surface is achieved by conversion of groups on the substrate&apos;s surface by a silicon modifying reagent such as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;Si&mdash;R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&mdash;X<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> where R is an alkyl group, such as methyl or ethyl, R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>is a linking group between silicon and X and X is a reactive group or a protected reactive group. The reactive group can also be a recognition moiety as discussed below. Silane derivatives having halogens or other leaving groups beside the displayed alkoxy groups are also useful in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> A number of siloxane functionalizing reagents can be used, for example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> 1. Hydroxyalkyl siloxanes (Silylate surface, functionalize with diborane, and H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to oxidize the alcohol) </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> b. 7-oct-1-enyl trichlorchlorosilane&rarr;&rarr;8-hydroxyoctyl </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> 2. Diol (dihydroxyalkyl) siloxanes (silylate surface and hydrolyze to diol) </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> a. bis (3-trimethoxysilylpropyl) amine&rarr;bis(silyloxylpropyl)amine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that an array of similarly useful functionalizing chemistries are available when SAM components other than siloxanes are used. Thus, for example similarly functionalized alkyl thiols can be attached to metal films and subsequently reacted to produce the functional groups such as those exemplified above </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the substrate is at least partially a metal film, such as a gold film, and the reactive group is tethered to the metal surface by an agent displaying avidity for that surface. In a presently preferred embodiment, the substrate is at least partially a gold film and the group which reacts with the metal surface comprises a thiol, sulfide or disulfide such as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Y&mdash;S&mdash;R<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&mdash;X<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>

X<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>can also be a recognition moiety as discussed below. Y is a member selected from the group consisting of H, R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&mdash;S&mdash;, wherein R<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>are independently selected. When R<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>are the same, symmetrical sulfides and disulfides result, and when they are different, asymmetrical sulfides and disulfides result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> A large number of functionalized thiols, sulfides and disulfides are commercially available (Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis). Additionally, those of skill in the art have available to them a manifold of synthetic routes with which to produce additional such molecules. For example, amine-functionalized thiols can be produced from the corresponding halo-amines, halo-carboxylic acids, etc. by reaction of these halo precursors with sodium sulfhydride. See, for example, Reid, ORGANIC CHEMISTRY OF BIVALENT SULFUR, Vol. 1, pp. 21-29, 32-35, vol. 5, pp. 27-34, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1958, 1963. Additionally, functionalized sulfides can be prepared via alkylthio-de-halogenation with a mercaptan salt. See, Reid, ORGANIC CHEMISTRY OF BIVALENT SULFUR, vol. 2, pp. 16-21, 24-29, vol. 3, pp. 11-14, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1960. Other methods for producing compounds useful in practicing the present invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the functionalizing reagent provides for more than one reactive group per each reagent molecule. Using reagents such as Compound 3, below, each reactive site on the substrate surface is, in essence, &ldquo;amplified&rdquo; to two or more functional groups: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;Si&mdash;R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&mdash;(X<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>

In a presently preferred embodiment, the Z groups of adjacent molecules participate in either an attractive (e.g., hydrogen bonding) or repulsive (e.g., van der Waals) interaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> In Formula 7, m is a number between 0 and 40, n is a number between 0 and 40, o is a number between 0 and 40 and p is a number between 0 and 40.1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment, the compounds of Formulae 6 and 7 are used in conjunction with an organosulfur compound, either halogentated or unhalogenated, that bears a recognition moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> When the organic layer is formed from a halogenated organosulfur compound, the organic layer can comprise a single halogenated compound or more than one halogenated compound having different structures. Additionally, these layers can comprise a non-halogenated organosulfur compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> The reactive functional groups (X<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and X<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) are, for example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> (a) carboxyl groups and various derivatives thereof including, but not limited to, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, N-hydroxybenztriazole esters, acid halides, acyl imidazoles, thioesters, p-nitrophenyl esters, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and aromatic esters; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> (b) hydroxyl groups which can be converted to esters, ethers, aldehydes, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> (c) haloalkyl groups wherein the halide can be later displaced with a nucleophilic group such as, for example, an amine, a carboxylate anion, thiol anion, carbanion, or an alkoxide ion, thereby resulting in the covalent attachment of a new group at the site of the halogen atom; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> (d) dienophile groups which are capable of participating in Diels-Alder reactions such as, for example, maleimido groups; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> (e) aldehyde or ketone groups such that subsequent derivatization is possible via formation of carbonyl derivatives such as, for example, imines, hydrazones, semicarbazones or oximes, or via such mechanisms as Grignard addition or alkyllithium addition; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> (f) sulfonyl halide groups for subsequent reaction with amines, for example, to form sulfonamides; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> (g) thiol groups which can be converted to disulfides or reacted with acyl halides; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> (i) epoxides which can react with, for example, amines and hydroxyl compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The reactive moieties can also be recognition moieties. The nature of these groups is discussed in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> The reactive functional groups can be chosen such that they do not participate in, or interfere with, the reaction controlling the attachment of the functionalized SAM component onto the substrate&apos;s surface. Alternatively, the reactive functional group can be protected from participating in the reaction by the presence of a protecting group. Those of skill in the art will understand how to protect a particular functional group from interfering with a chosen set of reaction conditions. For examples of useful protecting groups, See Greene et al., PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the SAM component bearing the recognition moiety is attached directly and essentially irreversibly via a &ldquo;stable bond&rdquo; to the surface of the substrate. A &ldquo;stable bond&rdquo;, as used herein, is a bond which maintains its chemical integrity over a wide range of conditions (e.g., amide, carbamate, carbon-carbon, ether, etc.). In another preferred embodiment the SAM component bearing the recognition moiety is attached to the substrate surface by a &ldquo;cleaveable bond&rdquo;. A &ldquo;cleaveable bond&rdquo;, as used herein, is a bond which is designed to undergo scission under conditions which do not degrade other bonds in the recognition moiety-analyte complex. Cleaveable bonds include, but are not limited to, disulfide, imine, carbonate and ester bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, it is advantageous to have the recognition moiety attached to a SAM component having a structure that is different than that of the constituents of the bulk SAM. In this embodiment, the group to which the recognition moiety is bound is referred to as a &ldquo;spacer arm&rdquo; or &ldquo;spacer.&rdquo; Using such spacer arms, the properties of the SAM adjacent to the recognition moiety can be controlled. Properties that are usefully controlled include, for example, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, surface-activity and the distance of the recognition moiety from the plane of the substrate and/or the SAM. For example, in a SAM composed of alkanethiols, the recognition moiety can be attached to the substrate or the surface of the SAM via an amine terminated poly(ethyleneglycol). Numerous other combinations of spacer arms and SAMs are accessible to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> The hydrophilicity of the substrate surface can be enhanced by reaction with polar molecules such as amine-, hydroxyl- and polyhydroxyl-containing molecules. Representative examples include, but are not limited to, polylysine, polyethyleneimine, poly(ethyleneglycol) and poly(propyleneglycol). Suitable functionalization chemistries and strategies for these compounds are known in the art. See, for example, Dunn, R. L., et al., Eds. POLYMERIC DRUGS AND DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS, ACS Symposium Series Vol. 469, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C. 1991. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The hydrophobicity of the substrate surface can be modulated by using a hydrophobic spacer arm such as, for example, long chain diamines, long-chain thiols, &agr;, &ohgr;-amino acids, etc. Representative hydrophobic spacers include, but are not limited to, 1,6-hexanediamine, 1,8-octanediamine, 6-aminohexanoic acid and 8-aminooctanoic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> The substrate surface can also be made surface-active by attaching to the substrate surface a spacer which has surfactant properties. Compounds useful for this purpose include, for example, aminated or hydroxylated detergent molecules such as, for example, 1-aminododecanoic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the spacer serves to distance the recognition moiety from the substrate or SAM. Spacers with this characteristic have several uses. For example, a recognition moiety held too closely to the substrate or SAM surface may not react with incoming analyte, or it may react unacceptably slowly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> When an analyte is itself sterically demanding, the reaction leading to recognition moiety-analyte complex formation can be undesirably slowed, or not occur at all, due to the monolithic substrate hindering the approach of the two components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the physicochemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, surface activity, conformation) of the substrate surface and/or SAM are altered by attaching a monovalent moiety which is different in composition than the constituents of the bulk SAM and which does not bear a recognition moiety. As used herein, &ldquo;monovalent moiety&rdquo; refers to organic molecules with only one reactive functional group. This functional group attaches the molecule to the substrate. &ldquo;Monovalent moieties&rdquo; are to be contrasted with the bifunctional &ldquo;spacer&rdquo; groups described above. Such monovalent groups are used to modify the hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, binding characteristics, etc. of the substrate surface. Examples of groups useful for this purpose include long chain alcohols, amines, fatty acids, fatty acid derivatives, poly(ethyleneglycol) monomethyl ethers, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> When two or more structurally distinct moieties are used as components of the SAMs, the components can be contacted with the substrate as a mixture of SAM components or, alternatively, the components can be added individually. In those embodiments in which the SAM components are added as a mixture, the mole ratio of a mixture of the components in solution results in the same ratio in the mixed SAM. Depending on the manner in which the SAM is assembled, The two components do not phase segregate into islands. See, Bain, C. D.; Whitesides, G. M., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>111:7164 (1989). This feature of SAMs can be used to immobilize recognition moieties or bulky modifying groups in such a manner that certain interactions, such as steric hindrance, between these molecules is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> The individual components of the SAMs can also be bound to the substrate in a sequential manner. Thus, in one embodiment, a first SAM component is attached to the substrate&apos;s surface by &ldquo;underlabeling&rdquo; the surface functional groups with less than a stoichiometric equivalent of the first component. The first component can be a SAM component liked to a terminal reactive group or recognition group, a spacer arm or a monovalent moiety. Subsequently, the second component is contacted with the substrate. This second component can either be added in stoichiometric equivalence, stoichiometric excess or can again be used to underlabel to leave sites open for a third component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> C. Recognition Moieties </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;recognition moiety&rdquo; refers to molecules which are attached to either &ohgr;-functionalized spacer arms or &ohgr;-functionalized SAM components. Furthermore, a recognition moiety can be presented by a polymer surface (e.g., a rubbed polymer surface). The recognition moieties bind to, or otherwise interact with, the analyte of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the recognition moiety comprises an organic functional group.

In still further preferred embodiments, the biomoleucle is a protein, antibody, peptide, nucleic acid (e.g., single nucleotides or nucleosides, oligo nucleotides, polynucleotides and single- and higher-stranded nucleic acids) or a combination thereof. In a presently preferred embodiment, the recognition moiety is biotin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> When the recognition moiety is an amine, in preferred embodiments, the recognition moiety will interact with a structure on the analyte which reacts by binding to the amine (e.g., carbonyl groups, alkylhalo groups). In another preferred embodiment, the amine is protonated by an acidic moiety on the analyte of interest (e.g., carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> In certain preferred embodiments, when the recognition moiety is a carboxylic acid, the recognition moiety will interact with the analyte by complexation (e.g., metal ions). In still other preferred embodiments, the carboxylic acid will protonate a basic group on the analyte (e.g. amine). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the recognition moiety is a drug moiety. The drug moieties can be agents already accepted for clinical use or they can be drugs whose use is experimental, or whose activity or mechanism of action is under investigation. The drug moieties can have a proven action in a given disease state or can be only hypothesized to show desirable action in a given disease state. In a preferred embodiment, the drug moieties are compounds which are being screened for their ability to interact with an analyte of choice. As such, drug moieties which are useful in practicing the instant invention include drugs from a broad range of drug classes having a variety of pharmacological activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Classes of useful agents include, for example, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).

Other drugs of use in conjunction with the present invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> When the recognition moiety is a chelating agent, crown ether or cyclodextrin, host-guest chemistry will dominate the interaction between the recognition moiety and the analyte. The use of host-guest chemistry allows a great degree of recognition-moiety-analyte specificity to be engineered into a device of the invention. The use of these compounds to bind to specific compounds is well known to those of skill in the art. See, for example, Pitt et al. &ldquo;The Design of Chelating Agents for the Treatment of Iron Overload,&rdquo; In, INORGANIC CHEMISTRY IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE; Martell, A. E., Ed.; American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., 1980, pp. 279-312; Lindoy, L. F., THE CHEMISTRY OF MACROCYCLIC LIGAND COMPLEXES; Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989; Dugas, H., BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY; Springer-Verlag, New York, 1989, and references contained therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a manifold of routes allowing the attachment of chelating agents, crown ethers and cyclodextrins to other molecules is available to those of skill in the art. See, for example, Meares et al., &ldquo;Properties of In Vivo Chelate-Tagged Proteins and Polypeptides.&rdquo; In, MODIFICATION OF PROTEINS: FOOD, NUTRITIONAL, AND PHARMACOLOGICAL ASPECTS;&rdquo; Feeney, R. E., Whitaker, J. R., Eds., American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., 1982, pp.370-387; Kasina et al. <highlight><italic>Bioconjugate Chem. </italic></highlight>9:108-117 (1998); Song et al., <highlight><italic>Bioconjugate Chem. </italic></highlight>8:249-255 (1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> In a presently preferred embodiment, the recognition moiety is a polyaminocarboxylate chelating agent such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). These recognition moieties can be attached to any amine-terminated component of a SAM or a spacer arm, for example, by utilizing the commercially available dianhydride (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> In still further preferred embodiments, the recognition moiety is a biomolecule such as a protein, nucleic acid, peptide or an antibody. Biomolecules useful in practicing the present invention can be derived from any source. The biomolecules can be isolated from natural sources or can be produced by synthetic methods. Proteins can be natural proteins or mutated proteins. Mutations can be effected by chemical mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis or other means of inducing mutations known to those of skill in the art. Proteins useful in practicing the instant invention include, for example, enzymes, antigens, antibodies and receptors. Antibodies can be either polyclonal or monoclonal. Peptides and nucleic acids can be isolated from natural sources or can be wholly or partially synthetic in origin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> In those embodiments wherein the recognition moiety is a protein or antibody, the protein can be tethered to a SAM component or a spacer arm by any reactive peptide residue available on the surface of the protein. In preferred embodiments, the reactive groups are amines or carboxylates. In particularly preferred embodiments, the reactive groups are the &egr;-amine groups of lysine residues. Furthermore, these molecules can be adsorbed onto the surface of the substrate or SAM by non-specific interactions (e.g., chemisorption, physisorption). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Recognition moieties which are antibodies can be used to recognize analytes which are proteins, peptides; nucleic acids, saccharides or small molecules such as drugs, herbicides, pesticides, industrial chemicals and agents of war. Methods of raising antibodies for specific molecules are well-known to those of skill in the art. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5/147,786, issued to Feng et al. on Sep. 15, 1992; U.S. Pat. No. 5/334,528, issued to Stanker et al. on Aug. 2, 1994; U.S. Pat. No. 5/686,237, issued to Al-Bayati, M. A. S. on Nov. 11, 1997; and U.S. Pat. No. 5/573,922, issued to Hoess et al. on Nov. 12, 1996. Methods for attaching antibodies to surfaces are also art-known. See, Delamarche et al. Langmuir 12:1944-1946 (1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Peptides and nucleic acids can be attached to a SAM component or spacer arm. Both naturally-derived and synthetic peptides and nucleic acids are of use in conjunction with the present invention. These molecules can be attached to a SAM component or spacer arm by any available reactive group. For example, peptides can be attached through an amine, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, or hydroxyl group. Such a group can reside at a peptide terminus or at a site internal to the peptide chain. Nucleic acids can be attached through a reactive group on a base (e.g., exocyclic amine) or an available hydroxyl group on a sugar moiety (e.g., 3&prime;- or 5&prime;-hydroxyl). The peptide and nucleic acid chains can be further derivatized at one or more sites to allow for the attachment of appropriate reactive groups onto the chain. See, Chrisey et al. <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>24:3031-3039 (1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> When the peptide or nucleic acid is a fully or partially synthetic molecule, a reactive group or masked reactive group can be incorporated during the process of the synthesis. Many derivatized monomers appropriate for reactive group incorporation in both peptides and nucleic acids are know to those of skill in the art. See, for example, THE PEPTIDES: ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, BIOLOGY, Vol. 2: &ldquo;Special Methods in Peptide Synthesis,&rdquo; Gross, E. and Melenhofer, J., Eds., Academic Press, New York (1980). Many useful monomers are commercially available (Bachem, Sigma, etc.). This masked group can then be unmasked following the synthesis, at which time it becomes available for reaction with a SAM component or a spacer arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> In other preferred embodiments, the peptide is attached directly to the substrate. See, Frey et al. <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>68:3187-3193(1996). In a particularly preferred embodiment, the peptide is attached to a gold substrate through a sulfhydryl group on a cysteine residue. In another preferred embodiment, the peptide is attached through a thiol to a spacer arm which terminates in, for example, an iodoacetamide, chloroacetamide, benzyl iodide, benzyl bromide, alkyl iodide or alkyl bromide. Similar immobilization techniques are known to those of skill in the art. See, for example, Zull et al. <highlight><italic>J. Ind. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>13:137-143 (1994). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the recognition moiety forms an inclusion complex with the analyte of interest. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the recognition moiety is a cyclodextrin or modified cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins are a group of cyclic oligosaccharides produced by numerous microorganisms. Cyclodextrins have a ring structure which has a basket-like shape. This shape allows cyclodextrins to include many kinds of molecules into their internal cavity. See, for example, Szejtli, J., CYCLODEXTRINS AND THEIR INCLUSION COMPLEXES; Akademiai Klado, Budapest, 1982; and Bender et al., CYCLODEXTRIN CHEMISTRY, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1978. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Cyclodextrins are able to form inclusion complexes with an array of organic molecules including, for example, drugs, pesticides, herbicides and agents of war. See, Tenjarla et al., <highlight><italic>J. Pharm. Sci. </italic></highlight>87:425-429 (1998); Zughul et al., <highlight><italic>Pharm. Dev.

<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> D. Mesegenic Layer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Any compound or mixture of compounds which forms a mesogenic layer can be used in conjunction with the present invention. The mesogens can form thermotropic or lyotropic liquid crystals. The mesogenic layer can be either continuous or it can be patterned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;thermotropic liquid crystal&rdquo; refers to liquid crystals which result from the melting of mesogenic solids due to an increase in temperature. Both pure substances and mixtures form thermotropic liquid crystals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Lyotropic,&rdquo; as used herein, refers to molecules which form phases with orientational and/or positional order in a solvent. Lyotropic liquid crystals can be formed using amphiphilic molecules (e.g., sodium laurate, phosphatidylethanolamine, lecithin). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> Both the thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals can exist in a number of forms including nematic, chiral nematic, smectic, polar smectic, chiral smectic, frustrated phases and discotic phases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;nematic&rdquo; refers to liquid crystals in which the long axes of the molecules remain substantially parallel, but the positions of the centers of mass are randomly distributed. Nematic crystals can be substantially oriented by a nearby surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Chiral nematic,&rdquo; as used herein refers to liquid crystals in which the mesogens are optically active. Instead of the director being held locally constant as is the case for nematics, the director rotates in a helical fashion throughout the sample. Chiral nematic crystals show a strong optical activity which is much higher than can be explained on the bases of the rotatory power of the individual mesogens. When light equal in wavelength to the pitch of the director impinges on the liquid crystal, the director acts like a diffraction grating, reflecting most and sometimes all of the light incident on it. If white light is incident on such a material, only one color of light is reflected and it is circularly polarized. This phenomenon is known as selective reflection and is responsible for the iridescent colors produced by chiral nematic crystals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Smectic,&rdquo; as used herein refers to liquid crystals which are distinguished from &ldquo;nematics&rdquo; by the presence of a greater degree of positional order in addition to orientational order; the molecules spend more time in planes and layers than they do between these planes and layers. &ldquo;Polar smectic&rdquo; layers occur when the mesogens have permanent dipole moments. In the smectic A2 phase, for example, successive layers show anti ferroelectric order, with the direction of the permanent dipole alternating from layer to layer. If the molecule contains a permanent dipole moment transverse to the long molecular axis, then the chiral smectic phase is ferroelectric. A device utilizing this phase can be intrinsically bistable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Frustrated phases,&rdquo; as used herein, refers to another class of phases formed by chiral molecules. These phases are not chiral, however, twist is introduced into the phase by an array of grain boundaries. A cubic lattice of defects (where the director is not defined) exist in a complicated, orientationally ordered twisted structure. The distance between these defects is hundreds of nanometers, so these phases reflect light just as crystals reflect x-rays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Discotic phases&rdquo; are formed from molecules which are disc shaped rather than elongated. Usually these molecules have aromatic cores and six lateral substituents. If the molecules are chiral or a chiral dopant is added to a discotic liquid crystal, a chiral nematic discotic phase can form.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Presently preferred mesogens are displayed in Table 1. In Table 1, R<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>are independently selected R groups. Presently preferred R groups include, but are not limited to, alkyl groups, lower alkyl, substituted alkyl groups, aryl groups, acyl groups, halogens, hydroxy, cyano, amino, alkoxy, alkylamino, acylamino, thioamido, acyloxy, aryloxy, aryloxyalkyl, mercapto, thia, aza, oxo, both saturated and unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons, heterocycles, arylalkyl, substituted aryl, alkylhalo, acylamino, mercapto, substituted arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, substituted heteroaryl, substituted heteroarylalkyl, substituted heterocyclic, heterocyclicalkyl </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> In a presently preferred embodiment, X<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>is a bond linking the two phenyl groups and the mesogen is a biphenyl. In another preferred embodiment X<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>is a C&boxH;N bond and the mesogen is a Schiff base. In still further preferred embodiments, R<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy and cyano moieties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment, the mesogen is a member selected from the group consisting of 4-cyano-4&prime;-pentylbiphenyl, N-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butlyaniline and combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The mesogenic layer can be a substantially pure compound, or it can contain other compounds which enhance or alter characteristics of the mesogen. Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the mesogenic layer further comprises a second compound, for example and alkane, which expands the temperature range over which the nematic and isotropic phases exist. Use of devices having mesogenic layers of this composition allows for detection of the analyte recognitino moiety interaction over a greater temperature range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the analyte first interacts with the recognition moiety and the mesogenic layer is introduced in its isotropic phase. The mesogenic layer is subsequently cooled to form the liquid crystalline phase. The presence of the analyte within regions of the mesogenic layer will disturb the equilibrium between the nematic and isotropic phases leading to different rates and magnitudes of nucleation at those sites. The differences between the nematic and isotropic regions are clearly detectable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> D. Patterned Liquid Crystals </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> One approach to the patterning of the mesogenic layer on flat and curved surfaces is based on the use of patterned SAMs of molecules to direct both the polar (away from the surface) and azimuthal (in the plane of the surface) orientations of the mesogenic layer. This method is simple and flexible, and any of the recently established procedures for patterning SAMs on surfaces (for example, microcontact printing or photo-patterning) (Talov et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>115: 5305 (1993); Kumar et al., <highlight><italic>Acc. Chem. Res. </italic></highlight>28: 219 (1995), and references therein; Xia et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>117: 3274 (1995), and references therein can be used; Jackman et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>269: 664 (1995)). Using any of these methods, SAMs which pattern liquid crystals can be easily extended to sizes ranging from hundreds of nanometers (Xia et al, <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>117: 3274 (1995), and references therein) to millimeters and permit both planar (parallel to the surface) and homeotropic (perpendicular to the surface) orientation of mesogenic layers; methods based on the rubbing of polymer films mainly provide manipulation of the in-plane alignment of mesogenic layers and cannot homeotropically align mesogenic layers. One class of useful SAMs has surface energies (&tilde;19 mJ/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) about half those of films of polyimides used for alignment of liquid crystals; low-energy surfaces are less prone to contamination by molecular adsorbates and dust particles than are high-energy ones. Because SAMs can also be patterned on non-planar surfaces (Jackman et al, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>269: 664 (1995)), patterned mesogenic structures formed with SAMs can be replicated on curved surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> The capacity to pattern mesogenic layer orientations on nonplanar surfaces provides procedures for the fabrication of tunable hybrid diffractive-refractive devices. For example, devices based on combinations of diffractive and refractive optical processes permit aplanatic or chromatic correction in lenses, spectral dispersion, imaging from a single optical element, and other manipulations of light (Resler et al, <highlight><italic>Opt. Lett. </italic></highlight>21, 689 (1996); S. M. Ebstein, ibid., p.1454; M. B. Stem, <highlight><italic>Microelectron. Eng. </italic></highlight>32, 369 (1996): Goto et al., <highlight><italic>Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. </italic></highlight>31, 1586 (1992); Magiera et al., <highlight><italic>Soc. Photo</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Opt. Instrum. Eng., </italic></highlight>2774, 204 (1996)). The capability to pattern mesogenic layers on curved surfaces also provides routes for the fabrication of displays with wide viewing angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> In a presently preferred embodiment, the tunable hybrid device permits the manipulation of light. In a further preferred embodiment, the device is a refractive-diffractive device. In a still further preferred embodiment, the device permits imaging from a single optical element. In yet another preferred embodiment, the device permits aplanatic or chromatic correction in lenses. In still another preferred embodiment, the device allows for spectral dispersion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> In another presently preferred embodiment, the SAM is layered on a material suitable for use as an electrode. In a preferred embodiment, the material is a metal film. In a further preferred embodiment, the metal film is a gold film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The patterned mesogenic layers of the instant invention can be tuned by the use of electric fields. In a preferred embodiment, the electric field is used to reversibly orient the mesogenic layer. In a still further preferred embodiment, the electric field is applied either perpendicular to, or in the plane of, the surface of the mesogenic layer. In another preferred embodiment, the oriented mesogenic layer modulates the intensity of light diffracted from the layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> The discussion above, concerning SAM components, SAM components with reactive groups and SAM components bearing recognition moieties is equally applicable in the context of this aspect of the invention. Thus, the constituents of the SAM can be chosen from any of a wide variety of appropriate molecules. In a presently preferred embodiment, the SAM comprises mixtures of R<highlight><superscript>21</superscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>14</subscript></highlight>SH and R<highlight><superscript>31</superscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>SH, where R<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>31 </superscript></highlight>are independently members elected from the group consisting of hydrogen, reactive groups and recognition groups, as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> E. Analytes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> The devices and methods of the present invention can be used to detect any analyte, or class of analytes, which interact with a recognition moiety in a manner that perturbs the mesogenic layer in a detectable manner. The interaction between the analyte and recognition moiety can be any physicochemical interaction, including covalent bonding, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, repulsive electronic interactions, attractive electronic interactions and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the interaction is an ionic interaction. In this embodiment, an acid, base, metal ion or metal ion-binding ligand is the analyte. In a still further preferred embodiment, the interaction is a hydrogen bonding interaction. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the hybridization of an immobilized nucleic acid to a nucleic acid having a complementary sequence is detected. In another preferred embodiment, the interaction is between an enzyme or receptor and a small molecule which binds thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the analyte competes for the recognition moiety with another agent which has been bound to the recognition moiety prior to introducing the analyte of interest. In this embodiment, it is the process or result of the analyte displacing the pre-bound agent which causes the detectable perturbation in the mesogenic layer. Suitable combinations of recognition moieties and analytes will be apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> In presently preferred embodiments, the analyte is a member selected from the group consisting of acids, bases, organic ions, inorganic ions, pharmaceuticals, herbicides, pesticides, chemical warfare agents, noxious gases and biomolecules. Importantly, each of these agents can be detected as a vapor or a liquid. These agents can be present as components in mixtures of structurally unrelated compounds, racemic mixtures of stereoisomers, non-racemic mixtures of stereoisomers, mixtures of diastereomers, mixtures of positional isomers or as pure compounds. Within the scope of the invention is a device and a method to detect a particular analyte of interest without interference from other substances within a mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Both organic and inorganic acids can be detected using the device and method of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, the recognition moiety comprises a group which is protonated by the acid. The result of this protonation is a detectable perturbation in the configuration of the mesogenic layer. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory of operation, the inventors currently believe that this perturbation can be achieved by a change in the size or conformation of the recognition moiety on protonation. Alternatively, the protonation may induce repulsion between proximate recognition moieties bearing charges of the same sign. Further, the protonation can induce an overall positive charge across the SAM which perturbs the electronic distribution of the molecules in the mesogenic layer. This perturbation can be due to an electronic redistribution in the mesogenic molecules or can be due to repulsive or attractive interaction between a charged mesogen and a similarly, or oppositely, charged SAM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the invention provides a device and a method for detecting bases. The methods for the detection and the mechanisms which allow such detection of bases are substantially similar to those discussed above in the context of acid detection; the notable exception being that the base will preferably deprotonate a group on a SAM component, spacer arm or substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Organic ions which are substantially non-acidic and non-basic (e.g., quaternary alkylammonium salts) can be detected by a recognition moiety. For example, a recognition moiety with ion exchange properties is useful in the present inveniton. A specific example is the exchange of a cation such as dodecyltrimethylammonium cation for a metal ion such as sodium, using a SAM presenting. Recognition moieties that form inclusion complexes with organic cations are also of use. For example, crown ethers and cryptands can be used to form inclusion complexes with organic ions such as quaternary ammonium cations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> Inorganic ions such as metal ions and complex ions (e.g. SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>, PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>) can also be detected using the device and method of the invention. Metal ions can be detected, for example, by their complexation or chelation by agents bound to a SAM component, spacer arm or the substrate. In this embodiment, the recognition moiety can be a simple monovalent moiety (e.g., carboxylate, amine, thiol) or can be a more structurally complex agent (e.g., ethylenediaminepentaacetic acid, crown ethers, aza crowns, thia crowns). The methods of detection and the mechanisms allowing such detection are substantially similar to those discussed in the context of acid detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Complex inorganic ions can be detected by their ability to compete with ligands for bound metal ions in ligand-metal complexes. When a ligand bound to a SAM component, a spacer arm or a substrate forms a metal-complex having a thermodynamic stability constant which is less than that of the complex between the metal and the complex ion, the complex ion will cause the dissociation of the metal ion from the immobilized ligand. The dissociation of the metal ion will perturb the mesogenic layer in a detectable manner. Methods of determining stability constants for compounds formed between metal ions and ligands are well known to those of skill in the art. Using these stability constants, devices which are specific for particular ions can be manufactured. See, Martell, A. E., Motekaitis, R. J., DETERMINATION AND USE OF STABILITY CONSTANTS, 2d Ed., VCH Publishers, New York 1992. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> Small molecules such as pesticides, herbicides, agents of war, and the like can be detected by the use of a number of different recognition moiety motifs. Acidic or basic components can be detected as described above. An agent&apos;s metal binding capability can also be used to advantage, as described above for complex ions. Additionally, if these agents bind to an identified biological structure (e.g., a receptor), the receptor can be immobilized on the substrate, a SAM component or a spacer arm. Techniques are also available in the art for raising antibodies which are highly specific for a particular small molecule. Thus, it is within the scope of the present invention to make use of antibodies against small molecules for detection of those molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the affinity of an analyte for a particular metal ion is exploited by having a SAM component, spacer arm or substrate labeled with an immobilized metal ion. The metal ion generally must have available at least one empty coordination site to which the analyte can bind. Alternatively, at least one bond between the metal and the metal-immobilizing agent must be sufficiently labile in the presence of the analyte to allow the displacement of at least one bond of the immobilizing reagent by the analyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the agent detected by binding to an immobilized metal ion is an organophosphorous compound such as an insecticide or an agent of war (e.g., VX, O-ethyl-S-(2-diisopropylaminoethyl)-methylthiophosphonate). Exemplary compounds which exhibit affinity for organophosphorous agents include, but are not limited to, Cu&plus;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>-diamine, triethylentetraamine-Cu<highlight><superscript>&plus;2</superscript></highlight>-chloride, tetraethylenediamine-Cu<highlight><superscript>&plus;2</superscript></highlight>-chloride and 2, 2&prime;-bipyridine-Cu<highlight><superscript>&plus;2</superscript></highlight>-chloride. See, U.S. Pat. No. 4/549,427, issued to Kolesar, Jr., E. S. on Oct. 29, 1985. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, antibodies to the particular agents are immobilized on the substrate, a SAM component or a spacer arm. Techniques for raising antibodies to herbicides, pesticides and agents of war are known to those of skill in the art. See, Harlow, Lane, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, Long Island, New York, 1988. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> Although many changes in the mesogenic layer can be detected by visual observation under ambient light, any means for detecting the change in the mesogenic layer can be incorporated into, or used in conjunction with, the device. Thus, it is within the scope of the present invention to use lights, microscopes, spectrometry, electrical techniques and the like to aid in the detection of a change in the mesogenic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> In those embodiments utilizing light in the visible region of the spectrum, the light can be used to simply illuminate details of the mesogenic layer. Alternatively, the light can be passed through the mesogenic layer and the amount of light transmitted, absorbed or reflected can be measured. The device can utilize a backlighting device such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,879, issued to Tsai, T.-S on Apr. 14, 1998. Light in the ultraviolet and infrared regions is also of use in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> Microscopic techniques can utilize simple light microscopy, confocal microscopy, polarized light microscopy, atomic force microscopy (Hu et al., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>13:5114-5119 (1997)), scanning tunneling microscopy (Evoy et al., <highlight><italic>J. Vac. Sci. Technol A </italic></highlight>15:1438-1441, Part 2 (1997)), and the like. </paragraph>

Bioelectron. </italic></highlight>11:757:768 (1996)), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> In a presently preferred mode of using the device of the present invention, the optical cell comprises two substrates that are spaced from about 10 micrometers to about 10 millimeters apart, preferably from about 20 micrometers to about 5 millimeters apart, more preferably from about 50 micrometers to about 0.5 millimeters apart. In this embodiment, the analyte is drawn into the optical cell by any of a number of techniques including, but not limited to, capillarity, electroosmosis, electophoresis, and centrifugation. Once the analyte has entered the optical cell, it is then displaced by drawing a mesogenic phase into the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> In yet another preferred embodiment, the optical cell (i.e., substrate) is of approximately cylindrical cross-section and the recognition moieties are attached to the inner surface of the cylinder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> In a seventh aspect, the invention provides a low energy surface having a mesogenic layer anchored planarly thereon. Low energy surfaces offer the advantage of being easy to clean. Thus, devices constructed from these surfaces have fewer defects and will display enhanced optical proerties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> In an eighth aspect, the invention provides a method for controlling tilt in an organic layer comprising a haloorganosulfer moiety, having a halogen content, adsorbed onto a substrate, the method comprising selecting the halogen content of the haloorganosulfur. In a preferred embodiment, the tilt is selected to provide a desired optical texture in a mesogenic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides a method for varying the optical texture of a mesogenic layer comprising a haloorganosulfur. The haloorganosulfur has a halogen content. The optical texture of the mesogenic layer is controlled by selecting the halogen content of the haloorganosulfur. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> The detailed examples which follow illustrate the device and methods of the invention as applied to amplifying, and transducing into an optical signal, the interaction of a recognition moiety hosted in a self-assembled monolayer and an analyte which interacts with the recognition moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> Example 1 illustrates the use of SAMs bearing biotin to detect avidin and an anti-biotin antibody (goat anti-biotin). The binding of avidin or an antibody to the biotin produces a marked change in the appearance of the mesogenic layer which allows the presence of both the avidin and anti-biotin to be detected by visual inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> Example 2 illustrates the use of a SAM bearing a carboxylic acid recognition moiety to detect the presence of hexylamine vapor. Similar to the results in example 1, the binding of the analyte to the recognition moiety produced a marked change in the appearance of the mesogenic layer, which could be visually detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> Example 3, illustrates that the orientation of a mesogenic layer is dependent on the ionization state and pKa of acidic recogntion moieties on the SAM components. The liquid crystal used in Example 3 is a nematic liquid crystal and the SAM is formed from &ohgr;-mercaptoundecanoic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> Example 4 illustrates the quantitative detection of metal ions by their binding to SAMs with carboxylic acid terminal groups. Similar to the examples above the binding is amplified and transduced into an optical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> Example 5 demonstrates the patterning of SAMs on a substrate. Further, Example 5 demonstrates that the anchoring orientation of a mesogenic layer can be controlled by the nature of the SAM components and the features of the pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> Example 6 demonstrates that the anchoring of mesogneic layers can be varied by using surfaces comprising fluorinated organosulfur compounds. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> Example 1 illustrates the amplification and transduction into optical outputs of receptor-mediated binding of proteins at surfaces. Spontaneously organized surfaces hosting ligands were designed so that protein molecules, upon binding to the ligands triggered changes in 1- to 20-micrometer thick films of supported liquid crystals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> Surfaces were designed with nanometer-scale topographies that could be erased by the specific binding of a protein to surface-immobilized ligands (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>), thus leading to macroscopic changes in the orientations of liquid crystals supported on these surfaces. First, thin films of polycrystalline gold were prepared (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) with roughnesses characterized by a maximum amplitude of &ap;2 nm and a maximum wavelength of &ap;50 nm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>). The deposition of the gold films was controlled so as to introduce an anisotropic roughness within the films (called hereafter &ldquo;anisotropic gold films (V. K. Gupta et al., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>12, 2587 (1996)). Although subtle, the anisotropic roughness was easily detected by observing the orientations of supported liquid crystals (V. K. Gupta et al., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>12, 2587 (1996)). Second, mixed, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were formed from Biotin-(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&lsqb;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NHCO(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>SH (BiSH) (J. Spinke et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Phys. </italic></highlight>99, 7012 (1993)) and CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>SH (C<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>SH) by immersion of the films of anisotropic gold in ethanolic solutions containing 9.6 &mgr;M of BiSH and 70.4 &mgr;M of C<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>SH for 8 hours (Mixed SAMs were also formed in a few minutes by using solutions that contained millimolar concentrations of the organothiols). The mixed SAMs were estimated to consist of &tilde;27% biotinylated species by linear interpolation of thicknesses (A) of single component SAMs formed from BiSH (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>BISH</subscript></highlight>&equals;3.8 nm) and C<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>SH (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>8SH&equals;1 nm) (All thickness measurements were performed using a Rudolph Auto ellipsometer with light (633 nm) incident at an angle of 70&deg;. A refractive index of 1.45 was used to estimate the thickness of bound layers of thiols and proteins. Standard deviations of ellipsometric thicknesses (&Dgr;) reported in this paper are &plus;/&minus;0.2 nm). Binding of the protein avidin (Av, 4.2 nm&times;4.2 nm&times;5.6 nm) (P. C. Weber et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>243, 85 (1989)) to biotin hosted within these SAMs was achieved by incubating the SAMs for 10-15 minutes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.004% by volume Triton X-100) containing 0.5 &mgr;M of Av (K. L. Prime et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>115, 10714 (1993)). The surfaces were then rinsed in deionized water for &tilde;30 seconds and dried with a stream of nitrogen for &tilde;30 seconds. To form liquid crystal cells, two SAMs were spaced apart using thin plastic film (Mylar&trade; or Saranwrap&trade; ) and then secured using paper clips (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Using capillarity, a drop of 4-cyano-4&prime;-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) was drawn in its isotropic phase (isotropic-nematic transition &tilde;34&deg; C.) into the cavity formed by the two surfaces. The liquid crystal was then cooled towards room temperature: a nematic texture was observed to spread across a 1 cm&times;1 cm-sized cell in &tilde;5-10 seconds. Optical images of the cell were recorded on a polarization microscope using transmission mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> When two mixed SAMs supported on anisotropic gold films were paired to form a liquid crystal cell, the polarized light image of the liquid crystal cell was uniform and featureless (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>). The liquid crystal within the cell was, therefore, uniformly oriented (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). When a second liquid crystal cell was prepared using mixed SAMs that were pretreated with PBS containing Av prior to filling with liquid crystal (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>AV</subscript></highlight>&equals;2.6 nm), the polarized light image was highly non-uniform and colored (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). The orientation of the liquid crystal showed no memory of the anisotropic roughness of the gold film (When rotated between crossed polars, the intensity of light transmitted through the sample did not show a large modulation in intensity. This result indicates the absence of a preferred orientation of the liquid crystal within the cell. The general features of the optical textures were not influenced by variations in rates of cooling of the liquid crystal to the ambient temperature) and resembled optical images of liquid crystal supported on mixed SAMs formed on gold films with no anisotropic roughness (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>). In contrast, the liquid crystal remained uniformly oriented when mixed SAMs were pretreated with PBS containing Av blocked with biotin (100-fold excess) (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>blkd AV</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.9 nm, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference>) or a SAM formed from C<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>SH that was pretreated in PBS containing Av (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>AV</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.4 nm) (K. L. Prime et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>115, 10714 (1993)). Therefore, specific binding of Av to mixed SAMs erases the effect of the nanometer-scale, anisotropic roughness of the gold on the orientation of the bulk liquid crystal and thus leads to a readily visualized change in the optical texture of the liquid crystal cell. It was estimated that within a 1 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>area of the mixed SAM (an easily visible area), &tilde;10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>Av molecules (&tilde;1 ng or &tilde;2.6 nm of coverage) control the orientations of &tilde;2&times;10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>mesogens (a 2 &mgr;m-thick film of liquid crystal). The binding of each Av molecule to the surface is, therefore, amplified into a reorientation of &gt;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>mesogens. Because less than half a monolayer of Av can change the orientation of the liquid crystal, and because liquid crystal films as thick as 100 &mgr;m can be oriented by surfaces, higher levels of amplification are possible (it has been demonstrated that specific binding of Av can cause reorientation of films of liquid crystals as thick as 20 &mgr;m (&tilde;2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>mesogens/protein). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> Because the binding of Av to biotin is unusually strong for a protein-ligand interaction (dissociation constant, K<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>&tilde;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;15 </superscript></highlight>M), the use of liquid crystals to detect the binding of antibodies to antigens (K<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9 </superscript></highlight>M) was also demonstrated (H. Bagci et al., <highlight><italic>FEBS, </italic></highlight>322, 47 (1993)). For example, the binding of affinity isolated, goat anti-biotin antibody (anti-Bi IgG) (Anti-Bi IgG was purchased from Sigma BioScience and antiFITC IgG was purchased from Molecular Probes. All measurements were performed in PBS containing 0.5 &mgr;M anti-Bi IgG and 0.004% Triton X-100. After binding the IgG in PBS, the samples were rinsed with deionized water and dried under a stream of nitrogen) to a mixed SAM formed from BiSH and C<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>SH (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>anti-Bi IgG</subscript></highlight>&equals;5.5 nm) caused the orientation of a supported liquid crystal to become non-uniform (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</cross-reference>). In contrast, neither a non-specific antibody such as rabbit polyclonal anti-fluorescein antibody (anti-FITC IgG, &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>anti-FITC IgC</subscript></highlight>&equals;0 nm) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</cross-reference>) nor bovine serum albumin (BSA, &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>BSA</subscript></highlight>&equals;1.4 nm) (the optical texture was the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</cross-reference>) caused a change in the orientation of the liquid crystal. In addition, a SAM formed from C<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>SH did not significantly bind anti-Bi IgG (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>anti-Bi IgG</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.1 nm) and thus oriented 5CB uniformly (the optical texture was the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> The results above demonstrate two further principles. First, it is possible to control the anisotropy within gold films so that the immobilization of ligands (such as BiSH) on these surfaces does not disturb the uniform orientation of the liquid crystal prior to binding of proteins. Oligopeptides (e.g., Ala&mdash;Ala&mdash;Pro&mdash;Phe) have also been introduced into SAMs without disturbing the uniform orientation of liquid crystals (Uniform anchoring of nematic 5CB was measured on mixed SAMs formed on anisotropic gold films by coadsorption from an ethanolic solution of 9 mM C<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>SH and 1 mM HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>&mdash;Ala&mdash;Ala&mdash;Pro&mdash;Phe&mdash;pNA, where Ala is alanine, Pro is proline, Phe is phenylalanine and pNA is p-nitroanilide.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> Second, the roughness of the gold film used in these experiments was such that the threshold surface concentration of Av or anti-Bi IgG needed to change the orientation of 5CB was greater than the level of non-specific adsorption but less than specific adsorption. This characteristic makes possible a sandwich-type assay in which a capture protein (macromolecular ligand) is supported on a surface, and the binding of a second protein (e.g., detecting antibody) to the capture protein is detected by a change in orientation of the liquid crystal. To demonstrate this principle, a mixed SAM was first treated with fluorescein-labeled avidin (FITC-Av) for 10 minutes (Fluorescein-labeled streptavidin (FITC-Av) was purchased from Pierce. All measurements were performed in PBS containing 0.5 &mgr;M FITC-Av and 0.004% Triton X-100. After binding the FITC-Av in PBS, the samples were rinsed with deionized water.). The bound FITC-Av (AFITC-Av &equals;1 nm) was below the threshold required to trigger a change in the orientation of 5CB (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</cross-reference>). The SAM supporting the bound FITC-Av was immersed into a solution of 0.5 &mgr;M anti-FITC IgG in PBS. The ellipsometric thickness of the bound protein after the second step was 3.5 nm and thus sufficient to trigger a change in the orientation of the liquid crystal (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</cross-reference>). Anti-FITC IgG did not bind to a mixed SAM in the absence of bound FITC-Av (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>anti-FITC IgG</subscript></highlight>&equals;&minus;0.1 nm) nor did anti-FITC IgG blocked with fluorescein bind to a surface presenting FITC-Av (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>FITC-Av/ati-FITC IgG</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.7 nm): both control experiments produced uniformly oriented liquid crystals (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F and</cross-reference>.<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>I). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> By repeating the above experiments using Av, and by binding anti-Av IgG to an antigenic epitope on Av, concentrations of anti-Av IgG in solution as low as 2.3 nM have been detected (Studies based on stress-induced chromatic transitions in polymer films have reported limits of detection for specific binding of pentavalent cholera toxin to ganglioside G<highlight><subscript>MI </subscript></highlight>(molecular weight &tilde;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>Da, Kd &tilde;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>10 M) to be 100 ppm (&tilde;1 &mgr;M) when using liposomes in solution and 20 ppm (&tilde;0.2 &mgr;M) when using supported films of the polymer (D. Charych et al, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>261, 585 (1993); D. Charych et al, <highlight><italic>Chem &amp; Biol </italic></highlight>3, 113 (1996); J.

<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> Twisted nematic liquid crystals (TN liquid crystals) are widely used in flat panel displays because reorientation of the twisted liquid crystal by an electric field provides high optical contrast ratios (The surfaces of a TNliquid crystal cell are designed such that the region of liquid crystal in contact with one surface is oriented at right angles to the region of liquid crystal in contact with the opposing surface (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). The liquid crystal sandwiched between the two surface regions of the cell undergoes a 90&deg; twist-type deformation, and the polarization of linearly polarized light transmitted through such a cell is rotated by 90&deg;. A twisted liquid crystal cell, when viewed between two parallel-polarizers, appears dark. In contrast, a cell containing liquid crystal that is not twisted appears bright between parallel polars (Liquid crystals: APPLICATIONS AND USES, B. Bahadur, Ed. (World Scientific, Singapore, 1990).). TNliquid crystals were also used to enhance the optical transduction of biotin-mediated binding of avidin to surfaces (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Optical read-out of the binding of proteins and ligands at surfaces can be further facilitated by using patterned SAMs (A. Kumar, et al., <highlight><italic>Acc. Chem. Res. </italic></highlight>28, 219 (1995), V. K. Gupta et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>276, 1533 (1997)). Surfaces were designed such that binding of Av to biotin-derivatized regions of a patterned SAM caused area-specific untwisting of a TNliquid crystal cell (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Patterns so formed with sizes of a few centimeters provide an easily read indicator of the presence of a biomolecule in solution (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A and SB). By using micrometer-sized patterns, it was also demonstrated that the binding of biomolecules at surfaces can be detected optically by the diffraction of light from periodic liquid crystal structures which form only when the biomolecules are bound to the surfaces (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C-E). </paragraph>

The evaporation direction between the opposing gold surfaces in the cell was oriented in the same direction.

<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> 3.3 Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> First, the out-of-plane orientation of the liquid crystals on SAMs pretreated at low and high pH was measured. Near planar orientation was observed using the crystal rotation technique. The polar angle from the surface was less than 1&deg;, for 5CB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> Second, the in-plane (azimuthal) orientation of the liquid crystal was measured by using polarized light microscopy. The in-plane orientation of liquid crystal with respect to the gold evaporation direction was determined by using a quarter wave plate (QWP) and a thin 2 &mgr;m cell prepared with SAMs (at low or high pH) filled with liquid crystal. Using a QWP, the orientation of the director was determined by rotating the cell until the greatest the shift in retardation between the slow axis of the nematic director and the optical axis of the QWP was observed. The shift in retardation was measured on a Michel-Levy color chart from the first and second order interference colors. Whereas no changes were observed in the out-of-plane orientation of the liquid crystals as a function of the pH of pretreatment, the in-plane orientations of nematic 5CB and MBBA were observed to be different when both surfaces were pretreated at low and high pH. Under these pretreatments, a uniform texture of liquid crystal was observed throughout the cell. The in-plane orientation of the 5CB and MBBA, however, was observed to shift 90&deg; based on the pH pretreatment of the surface at pH 2.5 (low pH) and 11.7 (high pH). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> In cells filled with 5CB or MBBA, using surfaces immersed at pH 2.5, the liquid crystal oriented parallel to the direction of gold deposition as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. However on monolayers conditioned at pH 11.7, the liquid crystals oriented perpendicular to the direction of gold deposition as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In both cases, there were no elastic deformation (twist, bend, or splay) in the bulk liquid crystal. These SAMs also exhibited reversible properties for orienting 5CB. Pretreatment of the SAM at pH 3.0 and subsequently at pH 11.7 resulted in 5CB orientation perpendicular to the deposition direction. The opposite pretreatment scheme results in parallel alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> Although the liquid crystals are known to contain significant amounts of water that could potentially erase the effect of the pretreatment of the surfaces (and thus the influence of the pretreatment of the surfaces on the orientations of the liquid crystals), the results described above demonstrate that this is not the case. The effect of the pretreatment of the liquid crystal changes the orientation of the liquid crystal. The concentration of water in our samples of 5CB was 42&plusmn;<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> mM as measured by Karl Fischer titration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> As described below, this effect can be further evidenced by the lateral patterning of a surface with COOH and COO<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> regions and observing the orientation of the liquid crystal in the vicinity of the boundary between the low and high pH regions. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shows the optical texture of a liquid crystal cell prepared by forming a SAM of HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>on one surface while the opposing surface was formed from HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH. The entire surface of HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH was pretreated at pH 3.0 and dried in nitrogen. This surface was then reversibly treated by half-dipping at pH 11.7 and carefully drying the surface in nitrogen. The anchoring of the liquid crystal was observed to be orthogonal on the adjacent regions of the acid surface pretreated at differing pHs. If ion exchange between the surfaces and the bulk liquid crystal was occurring, then time-dependent changes in the vicinity of this boundary would be observed. No change in the anchoring of the liquid crystal in the vicinity of the boundary over a period of 48 hours was observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> In cells designed with SAMs of HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>on one surface and HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH on the opposing surface, pH pretreatment of HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH, can be used to induce a bulk elastic deformation of the liquid crystal. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, at low pH, 5CB was uniformly oriented since the same in-plane liquid crystal orientation was imposed by both surfaces. At high pH, the monolayer of HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH imposed an in-plane boundary condition orthogonal to the HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>surface resulting in a twisted bulk orientation for the liquid crystal. This result demonstrated that the strength of anchoring on both surfaces was sufficient to create a deformation in the bulk which rotated the polarization of light by 90&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> In this cell, of nominal thickness 12 &mgr;m, 5CB was sandwiched between SAMs formed from HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH at pH 3.0 (region I) or pH 11.7 (region II). When viewed through cross polars (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), region I which was composed of surfaces anchoring the nematic director in the same direction appears dark due to the extinction of transmitted light. The bulk orientation of the liquid crystal was uniform and along a single direction.

The transition is visually illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at each pH through cross polars. Intermediate twist angles were not observed, however, at pH 3.8, twisted regions with dimensions of 100-1000 &mgr;m were observed within the uniformly oriented sample. The change in orientation from uniform to twisted alignment occurred through the proliferation of 90&deg; twisted domains of liquid crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> The rotation of the polarization through the cell filled with 5CB provided a simple, quantitative method of observing the discontinuous change in 5CB alignment. The twist angle was determined by simultaneously rotating the analyzer and the optical cell with respect to the polarizer to a minimum intensity. The twist angle as a function of pH is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A sharp discontinuity between pH 3.8 and pH 4.0 indicated a sharp, discontinuous, 90&deg; in-plane reorientation of 5CB. </paragraph>

The twist angle within these loops were, in general, the supplementary angle to the measured twist angle of the overall phase. The disclination line appeared dark between cross polars and bright between parallel polars indicating a disclination line of strength S&equals;&frac12;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0411&rsqb;</number> Twist angles for cells pretreated at pH&gt;3.8 were approximately 95-105&deg;. A 5-10&deg; error occurred from the glass slides being slightly twisted on the sample holders during the evaporation process. Therefore the gold was not deposited exactly along the perpendicular axis of the glass slide. Minor errors also occurred (&lt;5&deg;) when aligning the two opposing surfaces against each other during cell construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0412" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0412&rsqb;</number> Example 3 demonstrates that liquid crystals can be used to transduce into optical signals the transformation of a carboxylic acid group on a surface into a carboxylate salt. Small changes in structure of surfaces are known to influence the bulk orientation of liquid crystals. A discontinuous, 90&deg; in-plane reorientation of 5CB is observed depending upon the number of methylene groups composing an alkanethiol monolayer. An odd number of methylene units resulted in anchoring parallel to the deposition direction of the gold while an even number resulted in anchoring perpendicular to the deposition direction. The differences in orientation are attributed to the different orientations of the terminal methyl group within SAMs formed from even and odd numbered alkanethiols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> The acidity of the SAMs can be decreased using mixtures of HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH and HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)nCH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Using this technique, the pH transition from uniform to twisted orientation was controlled by forming SAMs from a mixture of 1 mM 4:1, 2:1, 1:2 HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH and HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The pH dependent transition was shifted to pH 7, pH 10, and pH 14, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrates the discontinous transition as measured through the twist angle that was observed for all the monolayers that were tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> The pH transition from uniform to twisted alignment was shifted by 0.4 pH units through control of the cell thickness. Since the distortion energy due to the twist distortion varies as the inverse of cell thickness, higher anchoring energies (which manifest in higher pH pretreatments) were required to induce a twist distortion in thinner cells. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates this dependence for three nominal cell thicknesses, 2 &mgr;m, 12 &mgr;m, and 30 &mgr;m over a pH range spanning uniform to twisted orientation. In the 2 &mgr;m cells, domains of twist as well as a complete twist in the bulk were observed over pH 3.8-4.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> In cells prepared with HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH on each surface, the orientation of 5CB went through the discontinuous, in-plane transition between pH 3.8 and 4.0. Since bulk distortions are not induced by these surfaces, we assumed this transition range is representative of the onset of ionization of the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0416" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0416&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> plots &THgr;aC<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>) as a function of pH for monolayer prepared from mixtures HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH and HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The percentage of chains terminated with COOH is labelled for each titration curve. The bolded arrows indicate the pH range where 5CB orientations in optical cells reoriented from uniform to twisted alignment. A number of features are present in these curves. First, as observed by Bain, the contact angles at low pH were constant and decreased at higher pH. See, Bain, C. D.; Whitesides, G. M., <highlight><italic>Langmuir, </italic></highlight>5:1370-1378 (1989)). Similarly, the breakpoint in the titration curves occurred at higher pH as the proportion of methyl terminated chains in the monolayer was increased. However, the pH transition for 5CB orientation increased with respect to the breakpoint pH (observed by contact angles) as the proportion of HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH decreased on the surface. In fact, on a SAM formed from only HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH, the pH of the twist transition (pH 3.8-4.0) was observed to be less than the pH of the breakpoint (pH 5.0-5.5). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0417" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0417&rsqb;</number> These results indicate a critical density of carboxylic acid terminal groups is required for the transition in 5CB from uniform to twisted. A linear relation is observed up to surface compositions of monolayers terminated with 41% carboxylic acid (2:1 HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>COOH and HS(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>CH). </paragraph>

Similar to the examples above, the binding of the metal ion is amplified and transduced into an optical signal by a liquid crystal layer. We use the binding of copper ions from aqueous solutions as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0419" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0419&rsqb;</number> First, microscope slides were covered with semi-transparent layer of titanium (30 Angstroms in thickness) and then gold (140 Angstroms). These metals were deposited with an oblique angle of incidence (50 degrees from normal of slide) using an electron beam evaporator. The metal-coated microscope slides were then immersed into a 1 mM solution of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (HOOC(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>SH) in ethanol for 1 hour. This procedure lead to the formation of SAMs that presented HOOC-groups at their outer surfaces. </paragraph>

The gold films supporting SAMs were then immersed for 5 minutes into these solutions of Cu<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> below pH 5.5. After removal from the aqueous solution, the surfaces were vigorously dried under nitrogen and then absolute ethanol in order to remove any nonspecifically attached Cu<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0421" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0421&rsqb;</number> Third, surfaces treated as described above were assembled into optical cells with a thickness (cavity thickness) of 12 micrometers. The cells were filled with 4-cyano-4 pentylbiphenyl (5CB) by capillarity at a temperature above the clearing temperature of 5CB. The resultant optical texture was analyzed with a polarizing microscope (Olympus) after the cells were cooled to room temperature. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> The patterning of mesogenic layers on surfaces is illustrated by fabrication of three linear diffraction gratings (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). These gratings differ in the manner of distortion of the mesogenic layers and thus their optical properties. Patterned SAMs were prepared by microcontact printing with an elastomeric stamp (Kumar et al., <highlight><italic>Acc. Chem. Res. </italic></highlight>28, 219 (1995), and references therein). The stamp was inked with an ethanolic solution of CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>SH and put in contact with ultrathin (100 &angst; thick), semi-transparent films of polycrystalline gold. SAMs were then formed on the unreacted areas of gold by immersion of the gold films in ethanolic solutions containing 1 mM of a second alkanethiol for 2 hours. Two surfaces supporting SAMs were subsequently paired and spaced apart with Mylar film. The space between the surfaces was filled with the nematic mesogen 4-cyano-4&prime;-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) by capillarity. A polarizing microscope with white light was used to image the patterned liquid crystals. Descriptions of experimental procedures have been reported elsewhere (Drawhorn et al., <highlight><italic>J. Phys. Chem. </italic></highlight>99, 16511 (1995); Gupta et al., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>12, 2587 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> Fabrication of the periodic liquid crystal structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> (grating A) requires uniform planar anchoring of the liquid crystal on the top surface of the cell and patterned planar anchoring of the mesogen with orthogonal azimuthal orientations in adjacent stripes on the bottom surface. Planar anchoring of nematic liquid crystals can be achieved by using single-component SAMs formed from CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight></subscript></highlight>SH (n&equals;4 to 17) on gold. (The observation of planar anchoring of mesogens on surfaces with energies as low as alkanethiols on gold (19 mN/m) is unusual. For example, monolayers formed from octadecyltrichlorosilane on silica have surface energies as low as alkanethiols on gold (19 mN/m) yet cause homeotropic anchoring of mesogens. The anisotropic part of the dispersion force acting between 5CB and gold influences anchoring of 5CB on SAMs formed from CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight></subscript></highlight>SH (Miller et al., <highlight><italic>Appl.

<paragraph id="P-0427" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0427&rsqb;</number> The anchoring is azimuthally uniform on SAMs supported on films of gold deposited with a 50&deg; angle of incidence (Gupta et al., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>12, 2587 (1996)). Oblique deposition of silicon oxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>) and metals can be used to align mesogens at surfaces (Urbach et al., ibid. 25, 479 (1974); J. L. Janning, <highlight><italic>ibid. </italic></highlight>21, 173 (1972)). This method, however, is not economically competitive with methods based on rubbed polymers when uniform alignment of a mesogen over a large area is required. In contrast, when patterned orientations of mesogens are required, processes based on rubbing become complex, and oblique deposition of metals can form the basis of simple and economical procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0428" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0428&rsqb;</number> The anchoring of 5CB is perpendicular to the direction of deposition of the gold on SAMs formed from odd alkanethiols (for example, n&equals;11; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference>) and parallel to the direction of deposition of gold on SAMs formed from even alkanethiols (for example, n&equals;12; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference>) (Gupta et al., <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. E </italic></highlight>54, 4540 (1996)); the alignment of 5CB on &ldquo;bare,&rdquo; obliquely deposited gold is planar and perpendicular to the direction of deposition of the gold). Differences in the orientation of the methyl groups at the surface of SAMs formed from odd and even alkanethiols on gold direct the in-plane orientation of the nematic mesogen (Gupta et al., <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. E </italic></highlight>54, 4540 (1996)); the orientation of methyl groups exposed at the surface of SAMs formed from CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight></subscript></highlight>SH on gold differ for odd and even alkanethiols because the aliphatic chains within these SAMs are tilted away from the surface normal by 30&deg; (Nuzzo et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>112,558 (1990)). In contrast, chains within SAMs formed from alkanethiols on silver and perfluorinated alkanethiols on gold are tilted by less than 10&deg; to 15&deg;, and there is no odd-even variation in the orientation of the methyl groups (CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) at the surface of these SAMs (Laibinis et al, <highlight><italic>ibid., </italic></highlight>113, 7152 (1991)); (Lenk et at., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>10, 4610 (1994)). No odd-even dependence was observed for the orientation of 5CB on SAMs formed from alkanethiols on silver or perfluorinated alkanethiols on gold: the anchoring of 5CB was perpendicular to the direction of deposition of the gold; a 90 azimuthal reorientation of a mesogen on a corrugated surface can be caused by a coupling of elastic and flexolectric effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0429" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0429&rsqb;</number> Patterned SAMs formed from CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>14</subscript></highlight>SH and CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>SH on obliquely deposited gold were used to fabricate grating A. The polarization of linearly polarized light is not changed by transmission (along the z direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference>) through the regions of the mesogenic layer with uniform planar anchoring but is rotated by 90&deg; upon transmission through regions of the mesogenic layer that are twisted by 90&deg; (Yeh, P., OPTICAL WAVES IN LAYEPED MEDIA (Wiley, New York, 1988)). When viewed through crossed polars, therefore, twisted regions of grating A appear bright (light is transmitted by the analyzer) and uniform regions appear dark (light is extinguished by the analyzer) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference>). The periodic change in refractive index across the grating causes diffraction of laser light (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0430" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0430&rsqb;</number> The grating in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference> (grating B) is based on homeotropic anchoring of the mesogenic layer on the top surface of the cell and patterned planar and homeotropic anchoring of the mesogenic on the bottom surface. Light incident on grating B with a linear polarization along the x direction will experience a periodic change in refractive index and will be diffracted. In contrast, light with polarization along the y direction will experience no spatial variations in refractive index and will not be diffracted. Mixed SAMs formed by coadsorption of long and short alkanethiols on gold to homeotropically anchor 5CB (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</cross-reference>) (Drawhorn et al., <highlight><italic>J. Phys. Chem. </italic></highlight>99, 16511 (1995)) Gupta et al., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>12, 2587 (1996); Yeh, P., OPTICAL WAVES IN LAYERED MEDIA (Wiley, New York, 1988)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0431&rsqb;</number> The planar to homeotropic transition in anchoring of 5CB observed on mixed SAMs formed from long and short alkanethiol on gold differs from past reports in which Langmuir-Blodgett films of lecithin were used: the anchoring of 5CB is homeotropic for all packing densities of lecithin (Hiltrop et al., Ber. <highlight><italic>Bunsen</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Ges. Phys. Chem. </italic></highlight>98, 209 (1994)) in a grating of type B. A polarized light micrograph of the mesogenic grating viewed through crossed polars is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</cross-reference>. Dark stripes correspond to regions of the grating in which the polarization of linearly polarized light was not changed by transmission through the mesogen; these stripes remained dark when the sample was rotated between the crossed polars, thus confirming homeotropic anchoring in these regions. Bright stripes correspond to regions of the mesogenic layer distorted by planar anchoring of the layer on the bottom surface and homeotropic anchoring of the layer on the top surface of the cell. Patterned homeotropic and planar anchoring of mesogens has not been demonstrated in past work that was based on photo-alignment or rubbing techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0432&rsqb;</number> In contrast to grating B, the diffraction of light by the grating in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</cross-reference> (grating C) was polarization insensitive. When grating C was viewed under crossed polars, either uniformly bright stripes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>D, polarization of incident light between x andy) or uniformly dark stripes (polarization of incident light along x or y) was observed. The boundaries between stripes, which correspond to regions in which two different distortions of the mesogens meet, were visible in the optical micrographs (dark lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</cross-reference>). The lack of measurable contrast between adjacent stripes for all polarizations of incident light is consistent with the mesogenic layer structure of grating C. A similar type of layer structure has been reported by Chen and co-workers who use a two-step rubbing process (Chen et al., <highlight><italic>Appl. Phys. Lett. </italic></highlight>67, 2588 (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0433" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0433&rsqb;</number> The polarization sensitivity of gratings B and C was further tested by viewing these gratings with linearly polarized light (not crossed polars). When grating B was viewed with light having a linear polarization along the x direction, the grating pattern was visible (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference>) because the incident light experienced a spatially periodic refractive index. With light polarized along the y direction, however, only faint edges of the stripes were Seen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>B); these edges did not cause measurable diffraction of light. In contrast, because grating C is insensitive to the polarization of incident light, the grating was visible upon illumination by light with polarization along x or y (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C and 18D</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> Tuning of these patterned mesogen structures was possible by using electric fields. When gold surfaces supporting SAMs were used as electrodes, an electric field could be applied perpendicular to the surfaces. Reversible application of the electric field reorients the mesogens and thus modulated the intensity of light diffracted from the gratings (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</cross-reference>). In-plane electric fields were also used (in-plane switching refers to the use of an electric field that is applied parallel to the surface of the cell). Devices based on in-plane switching of a mesogen have been used in FPDs with wide viewing angles (Ohe et al., <highlight><italic>Appl. Phys. Lett. </italic></highlight>69, 623 (1996); Ohta et al., <highlight><italic>IEICE </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>Inst. Electron. Inf Commun. Eng.</italic></highlight>) <highlight><italic>Trans. Electron. E</italic></highlight>79-C, 1069 (1996)) to reorient these patterned mesogenic structures. We observe SAMs to be stable upon application of an electric field across a cell filled with mesogen. Past studies have reported electrochemical desorption of SAMs in aqueous solutions of electrolytes (Widrig et al., <highlight><italic>J. Electroanal. Chem. </italic></highlight>310, 335 (1991); Waliquid crystalzak et al., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>7, 2687 (1991)). In general, the alignment of mesogens on SAMs formed from long-chain alkanethiols is stable over months. Stability over 30 years can be achieved by using polymerizable SAMs (T. Kim et al., <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>12, 6065 (1996)) or mesogens doped with alkanethiols or reducing agents to prevent oxidative degradation of the SAMS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> The methods reported here permit fabrication of complex mesogen structures in two simple processing steps. Surfaces can be patterned with regions of mesogens that differ in shape and have sizes ranging from micrometers to centimeters (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</cross-reference>). The mesogens can also be patterned on nonplanar surfaces (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

Self-assembled monolayers were formed for 2 hours in ethanolic solutions that contained a 1 mM total concentration of thiol. Binary mixed SAMs were formed by coadsorption of the thiols such that the compositions of SAMs were 1:1 for SAMs formed from 1 and 2 and from 1 and 3. The compositions of the SAMs were estimated by XPS &lsqb;Solution compositions of 1:1 and 3:1 were needed to form surface compositions of 1:1 for mixed SAMs formed from 1 and 2 and 1 and 3, respectively.; Laibinis, P. E., et al., 1992<highlight><italic>, J. Phys. Chem., </italic></highlight>96, 5097. The compositions of mixed SAMs formed under these conditions were determined by the kinetics of chemisorption. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> Advancing and receding contact angles of hexadecane were measured using a Rame-Hart goniometer and environmental chamber. A drop of hexadecane was placed in contact with the surface using the needle of a syringe. By increasing or decreasing the volume of the drop, the advancing and receding contact angles were measured. The environmental chamber was purged with nitrogen during measurements of the contact angles to avoid contamination of the SAMs. All contact angles reported are the averages of at least 12 measurements at four different places on the sample. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> Self-assembled monolayers supported on films of gold were paired and spaced apart by 2 or 25 &mgr;m spacers of mylar to form optical cells. A drop of 5CB was heated into its isotropic phase, drawn between the surfaces of the optical cells by capillary action, and then cooled slowly into its nematic phases (&tilde;1&deg; C./minute). A polarized light microscope (Olympus) was used to observe the optical textures of the liquid crystals at room temperature. See, Gupta, V. K. et al., 1996<highlight><italic>, Langmuir, </italic></highlight>12, 2587.; Gupta, V. K., et al., 1996<highlight><italic>, Chemistry of Materials, </italic></highlight>8, 1366. Conoscopic interference figures (Gupta, V. K. et al., 1996<highlight><italic>, Langmuir, </italic></highlight>12, 2587; Gupta, V. K., et al., 1996<highlight><italic>, Chemistry ofMaterials, </italic></highlight>8, 1366) were used to confirm the orientation of the direction of liquid crystals relative to the substrates in uniformly anchored samples. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> 6.2a Single Component SAMs Formed From Semi Fluorinated Thiols </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> The cartoons presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> summarize the structure of SAMs formed from 1-3 and 5. All four compounds form densely packed and highly ordered SAMS. The semifluorinated chains are, in general, tilted away from the normal less than the chains in SAMs formed from alkanethiols; the semifluorinated chains appear to lie normal to the surface when they contain short (&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2&mdash;</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>sequences (e.g., 1 and 2) The perfluorinated chains (outer region) within SAMs formed from 3 are tilted away from the normal more than the perfluorinated chains within SAMs formed from 1 and 2. The tilt of the aliphatic chains (inner region) in SAMs formed from 3 is less than the tilt of the aliphatic chains of 5 &lsqb;Solution compositions of 1:1 and 3:1 were needed to form surface compositions of 1:1 for mixed SAMs formed from 1 and 2 and 1 and 3, respectively.&rsqb;. Evidence for hydrogen bonding between C&boxH;O and NH within SAMs formed from 1 has been observed in IR spectra: the hydrogen bonding does not appear to alter the packing density of the chains on the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> Self-assembled monolayers formed from 1-3 were characterized by ellipsometry and contact angles of hexadecane, in addition to the IR measurements reported above. The ellipsometric thicknesses of SAMs formed from 1-3 were measured to be 17 &angst;, 15 &angst; and 26 &angst;, respectively, consistent with the formation of densely packed. The advancing and receding contact angles of hexadecane were 75-76&deg; and 71-73&deg;, respectively, for all samples with the exception of the advancing contact angle measured on SAMs formed from 3. All contact angles are consistent with presentation of CF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and CF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>groups at the outer surface of each SAM. See, Ulman, A., 1991<highlight><italic>, An Introduction to Ultrathin Organic Films: From Langmuir-Blodgett to Self Assembly </italic></highlight>(San Diego, Calif.: Academic Press). The advancing contact angle of hexadecane measured on SAMs formed from 3 was 79&deg;, suggesting that the outer regions of this SAM was structured differently than SAMs formed from 1 or 2 (see comment above regarding tilt of chains). Optical cells assembled with surfaces supporting SAMs formed from 3 did not fill by capillary action when 2 &mgr;m-thick mylar was used to space apart the surfaces of the cells. Reported, therefore, are results for 3 with cells with surfaces spaced apart by 25 &mgr;m-thick mylar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> Optical textures of 5CB anchored on SAMs formed from 1-3 and 5 are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. Optical textures of 5CB anchored on SAMs formed from 6 have been published elsewhere and are similar to 5. See, Gupta, V. K., et al., 1996<highlight><italic>, Langmuir, </italic></highlight>12, 2587.; Gupta, V. K.; Miller, W. J.; Pike, C. L. et al., 1996<highlight><italic>, Chemistry of Materials, </italic></highlight>8, 1366. The diffuse, meandering branches emerging from defects of strength &frac12; (two branches) within 5CB supported on SAMs formed from either 1 or 2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are consistent with planar and azimuthally degenerate anchoring of 5CB. In contrast, the optical textures of 5CB in contact with SAMs formed from 5 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) have a grainy appearance with characteristic dimensions that are much smaller than observed with SAMs formed from either 1 and 2. Although meandering branches and &frac12; defects are not generally observed when 5CB is anchored on SAMs formed from alkanethiols, measurements of the polar anchoring of 5CB on SAMs formed from CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>SH (an alkanethiol that forms a SAM of similar thickness to 1 or 2) confirm planar anchoring. See, Gupta, V. K., et al., 1996<highlight><italic>, Chemistry of Materials, </italic></highlight>8, 1366. Thus, the anchoring of 5CB on SAMs formed from semifluorinated thiols 1 and 2 and alkanethiols is planar. We note also that the spatial correlation of the azimuthal alignment of the director is greater on SAMs formed from semifluorinated thiols than SAMs formed from alkanethiols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> The optical textures of 5CB anchored on SAMs formed from 3 were different from 1 and 2. The textures observed on SAMs formed from 3 were not schlieren, but &ldquo;marbled&rdquo; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The characteristic dimension of the domains was larger than for SAMs formed from CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>SH (a monolayer of similar thickness to 3). In domains that were large enough to obtain a conoscopic image (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the position of the interference fringes indicated a tilt of the optical axis (&gt;&gt;15&deg;) away from the surface normal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> 6. 2b Mixed SAMs Formed by Coadsorption of Semifluorinated Thiols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> Self-assembled monolayers were formed by coadsorption of either 1 and 2 or 1 and 3. The compositions of the mixed SAMs were confirmed to be 1:1 by XPS. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows schematic illustrations of the mixed SAMs formed from the semifluorinated thiols, and a mixed SAM formed from 5 and 6. In the discussion that follows we use the variable &Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>to denote the difference in the length of the short and long chains within mixed SAMs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> The contact angles were consistent with the presentation of CF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and CF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>groups at the surface of the SAM except perhaps for the receding contact angle of SAMs formed from 1 and 3 (68&deg;, see below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> The IR band corresponding to the amide II stretch (NH in-plane bending, 1545 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>) measured using SAMs formed from 1 and 2 is similar to the position of the amide II stretch measured using SAMs formed from 1. This observation indicates hydrogen bonding takes place within the mixed SAM which, in turn, suggests incomplete mixing&mdash;and possibly islanding&mdash;of 1 and 2 within the mixed SAMs; hence, ideal mixing of species within the mixed SAM formed from 1 and 2 has not occurred. In contrast, the FTIR spectra measured with SAMs formed from 1 and 3 does show a shift of the amide II frequency to lower wave numbers, from which it can be inferred that there is true mixing of the two species within the SAM. The influence of the level of molecular mixing within the mixed SAMs on the anchoring or liquid crystals and (and contact angles) is unknown. The degree of mixedness could, however, account for the lower receding contact angles of hexadecane measured on SAMs formed from 1 and 3 (see above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0454" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0454&rsqb;</number> The optical textures of 5CB anchored on mixed SAMs formed from 1 and 2 (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>&equals;2 &angst;) were schlieren (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), although no defects with strength &frac12; could be found. Conoscopic images obtained from regions removed from defects showed interference fringes consistent with a tilt of the director (&ap;15&deg;-20&deg;) away from the surface normal (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In contrast, mixed SAMs formed from 1 and 3 (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>&equals;9 &angst;) caused homeotropic anchoring of 5CB (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Mixed SAMs formed from 4 and 5 (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>&equals;3 &angst;) cause near-planar anchoring (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) while past studies have shown that homeotropic anchoring is obtained on mixed SAMs formed from 4 and 6 (&Dgr;<highlight><subscript>t</subscript></highlight>&equals;9 &angst;). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to polymers having ordered, monodisperse macropores, their corresponding ordered, monodisperse colloids, and methods of making same. More particularly, the present invention relates to polymers synthesized by first polymerizing monomers around an ordered, monodisperse colloidal template and then chemically removing the template to yield a polymer product having ordered, monodisperse and interconnected pores. The present invention further relates to second-generation colloids synthesized by infiltrating various materials into the aforementioned porous polymers, which act as a mold for colloid growth, and then removing the macroporous polymer to yield an ordered, monodisperse colloid. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Macroporous Materials </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A material whose molecular structure is permeable to fluid or gas flow is porous. These materials are frequently characterized by the size of their pores, which are voids in the material: very small pores having diameters less than 2 nanometers (nm) are called micropores; intermediate size pores having diameters between 2 and 50 nm are called mesopores; and very large pores having diameters greater than 50 nm are called macropores. Conventional porous materials have randomly distributed voids that exhibit neither shape nor size uniformity. In contrast, voids or particles possessing a periodic distribution or lattice are referred to as ordered and those having a narrow size and shape distribution are referred to as monodisperse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Macroporous materials, those having macropores, have a wide range of applications in chemistry. In particular, macroporous polymers are useful as catalytic surfaces and supports, separation and adsorbent media, biomaterials, chromatographic materials, and thermal, acoustic and electrical insulators. In many of these areas, the utility of the porous system is a sensitive function of the internal pore diameters, their distribution and their morphology. Consequently, many synthetic approaches to creating these materials, both polymeric and inorganic, have focused on creating internal voids with monodisperse and controllable diameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Macroporous materials having not only monodisperse voids but also long-range three-dimensional ordering are referred to herein as ordered, monodisperse macroporous materials. Such materials are potentially valuable in optical applications. For example, materials having arrays of ordered, spherical pores whose diameters are about 500 nm act as diffractive optics for visible light. Furthermore, numerous optical applications have been suggested for well-ordered materials having long-range dielectric periodicity. These materials are potentially useful as substrates for planar waveguides; infrared filters; linear and nonlinear optics and chemical sensors; and for the control of spontaneous emission rates. These materials are traditionally formed using electron beam or photolithography techniques. Manufacturing limitations imposed by such processing have generally limited their utility to longer wavelength infrared and microwave applications and/or periodic structures of only two dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To be useful in optical technologies, an ordered, monodisperse macroporous material must be of high optical quality (no cracks or bubbles), controlled thickness, and uniform over a square centimeter or more. Although numerous methods have been developed for the fabrication of well-ordered macroporous materials&mdash;e.g., ion-track etching polymerization, chemically induced phase separation, block copolymer self-assembly, and copolymerization&mdash;these methods do not provide the long-range crystalline order and sample format required for optical applications. One promising technique for achieving long-range crystalline order involves the self-assembly of a sacrificial template to define the porous structure. Work in the last few years has demonstrated the utility of self-organizing systems as templates for the growth of a second material. These self-organized systems include surfactants, biological systems, liquid-droplet surfaces, and emulsions. Many of these systems are capable of producing macroporous materials of both polymers and inorganic oxides with pore sizes &gE;50 nm. Unfortunately, however, the templates derived from these systems are polycrystalline, and the resulting samples lack the long range order and uniformity necessary for optical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,228,340 (&ldquo;the &apos;340 patent&rdquo;) teaches the production of ceramics having spherical pores with a controllable pore size and a narrow pore size distribution. The &apos;340 patent discloses the use of aqueous and nonaqueous emulsions as templates around which ceramics are deposited through a sol-gel process. Following the deposition, the emulsion template is removed by drying and heat treatment. Unfortunately, the macroporous ceramics disclosed in the &apos;340 patent undergo significant shrinkage and although the pores show a &ldquo;high degree of order,&rdquo; there is no mention of the long-range periodicity necessary for optical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,626 (&ldquo;the &apos;626 patent&rdquo;) teaches a method for patterning materials according to a predetermined pattern by infiltrating nanocrystals into a template, sintering the nanocrystals into a monolithic structure, and then removing the template. According to the &apos;626 patent, an appropriate template includes sub-micron spheres which self-assemble into colloidal crystals. The &apos;626 patent also discloses selective chemical etching as a means for removing silica spheres. The &apos;626 patent does not, however, disclose products having the long-range periodicity necessary for optical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Simply put, the quest for ordered, monodisperse macroporous materials suitable for optical applications has proved unsuccessful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Monodisperse Colloids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Colloids are materials resulting from the aggregation of small particles suspended in solution. Colloids comprised of monodisperse particles potentially offer the benefits of long-range order and periodicity because such colloids can adopt a long-range crystalline lattice. Colloids that have adopted a long-range crystalline form are referred to herein as ordered, monodisperse colloids. Monodisperse colloids possess uniform physical and chemical properties useful for the quantitative evaluation of the optical, magnetic, electrokinetic, or adsorptive behavior of colloidal matter. In addition, highly uniform colloids offer superior properties for commercial applications ranging from magnetic recording to optical pigments. When sedimented, colloids composed of monodisperse particles can form three-dimensional (3D) periodic ordered, monodisperse colloids. Existing strategies for preparing ordered, monodisperse colloids generally manipulate the chemistry of colloid formation. However, only silica and some polymer materials can be routinely prepared with the narrow size distributions required for forming monolithic high quality ordered, monodisperse colloids. Unfortunately, these colloids do not exhibit the optical, nonlinear optical, or electro-optical functionality of other materials. Consequently, ordered, monodisperse colloids exhibiting desirable optical, nonlinear optical, or electro-optical properties are difficult, if not impossible, to prepare under the prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention stems from the discovery that polymer materials having ordered, monodisperse pores may be prepared by polymerizing monomers around an ordered, monodisperse colloidal template and that, following removal of the template, the resulting macroporous polymer may be used as a mold for preparing ordered, monodisperse colloids from a variety of materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The principal steps for preparing the macroporous polymers and their corresponding colloids are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. First, an ordered, monodisperse colloidal template is prepared from an appropriate material, such as silica nanospheres, according to an appropriate technique, such as the convective self-assembly method described below. This first-generation colloidal template exhibits a crystalline lattice that is ordered over a macroscopic distance&mdash;e.g., approximately 1 centimeter (cm) in length. Second, polymerizable monomers are infiltrated into the template to form a thin monomer film housing the template. Infiltrate in this context means to fill the void spaces in and around the template. Third, the monomers are polymerized to yield a solid polymer film. Fourth, the first-generation colloidal template is selectively removed, such as by chemical etching, to yield a polymer film having ordered, monodisperse and spherical pores that are interconnected with one another. The degree of interconnectedness can be precisely controlled through the viscosity of the starting monomer and/or the temperature of the polymerization. The resulting macroporous polymer can serve numerous uses including optical and micro-filtration applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the ordered, monodisperse macroporous polymer may serve as a mold for the growth of a new, second-generation colloid. Second-generation colloid refers here to a colloid whose morphology is patterned on the morphology of the first-generation colloidal template. This is accomplished by filling the ordered, monodisperse pores in the polymer, in whole or in part, with one or more of a variety of materials. The porous polymer may then be selectively removed to yield the second-generation colloid. This method leverages the crystalline nature of, for example, monodisperse silica colloids by effectively replicating their size distribution and arrangement in many other materials through a process analogous to the lost-wax method used to create molds for casting sculptures. In short, rather than developing separate chemical methods for preparing ordered, monodisperse colloids from a variety of materials, the present approach uses high-quality ordered, monodisperse colloids as templates for the formation of second-generation colloids from a variety of materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A key feature of the macroporous polymers disclosed herein is that they are ordered over large distances (at least about 1 cm) and highly uniform because of the assembly method used to construct them. Such long-range order and uniformity are essential, as they permit the preparation of macroscopically-sized ordered, monodisperse colloids. In addition, by using the macroporous polymers as molds for second-generation colloids, the macroporous polymers provide a wide range of control over particle formation, and diverse colloid shapes and architectures can be formed directly in a dense and crystalline format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The first-generation colloidal template of the present invention can be prepared from monodisperse particles having appropriate properties. Important properties include size and size range; the ease with which they can be assembled into an ordered colloid; their compatibility with a variety of polymer systems; and the ease with which they can be selectively removed without damage to their polymer housing. Polymers may be introduced either through polymerization of the monomer, or through the introduction of a high-temperature melt of pre-polymerized material. A person of ordinary skill in the art will immediately recognize that many materials may potentially serve the as the first-generation colloidal template according to the disclosed methods. Therefore, without limiting the scope of the invention, the monodisperse particles utilized in the present disclosure are preferably silica nanospheres. Such spheres can be synthesized relatively easily over a narrow size range with controllable diameters, form monodisperse, ordered colloids through a convective self-assembly process, are compatible with a wide range of polymer systems, and can be selectively removed through chemical treatment with hydrofluoric acid. As used herein, the term silica is meant to include all glass materials such as glass microspheres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The macroporous polymers of the present invention can be prepared from a variety of polymeric systems. The compatibility of porous polymers with many solvents and chemicals allow these materials to form a diverse range of colloidal materials within their pores including ceramic, polymer, semiconductor and metal materials. The polymer systems useful for preparing the macroporous polymers of the present invention include those capable of infiltrating the first-generation colloidal template described above. A person of ordinary skill in the art will immediately recognize that numerous polymer systems may be used. Without limiting the scope of the invention, representative polymer system examples include polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA), poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA), poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA), poly(allyl methacrylate) (PAMA), poly(2-ethoxylethyl methacrylate), poly(allyl chloride), polyurethane, epoxy, polyacrylamide, polypyrrole, polyaniline, poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(vinyl acetate), poly(ethyl methacrylate-co-methyl acrylate), poly-&agr;-methylstyrene, and poly(methylmethacrylate-co-butyl methacrylate). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The second-generation ordered, monodisperse colloids of the present invention may be prepared from a wide variety of materials including ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, metals and their precursors. In fact, because the morphology of the second-generation colloid is dictated largely by the morphology of the first generation colloidal template rather than by the intrinsic properties of the second-generation colloidal material, the choice of material for the second-generation colloid is largely unlimited. A person of ordinary skill in the art will immediately recognize that the ordered, monodisperse colloids formed by the method of the present invention can be prepared from numerous materials without departing from the scope of the invention. Without limiting the scope of the invention, representative examples include titania, zirconia, alumina, polypyrrole, poly(p-phenylenevinylene), cadmium sulfide, silver chloride, gold and nickel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the embodiments are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. </paragraph>

Through strict control of the reaction conditions, nanospheres with diameters ranging from 200 to 700 nm and relative standard deviation smaller than five percent were obtained. The sizes and size distributions of these samples were obtained from SEM and DLS measurements. Over 200 nanospheres were sized using SEM in order to arrive at the reported diameters. Before deposition, the silica alcosols were washed with 200 proof ethanol by repeated centrifugation and ultrasonic dispersion cycles in order to remove impurities, such as ammonia, water and unreacted tetraethoxysilane.

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Three-dimensionally ordered, monodisperse colloids with thicknesses ranging from one monolayer to approximately 50 &mgr;m were fabricated according to the method disclosed in P. Jiang, J. F. Bertone, K. S. Hwang, V. L. Colvin, &ldquo;Single-Crystal Colloidal Multilayers of Controlled Thickness&rdquo;, Chem. Mater., 11(8), 1999, 2132-2140, which is hereby incorporated by reference. A microslide is dipped into a purified silica/ethanol dispersion. Through convective self-assembly, an iridescent colloidal single crystal grows on the surface within three to four days while the ethanol evaporates. By adjusting particle size and volume fraction, the thickness of the resulting film can be precisely controlled. Typically, films of 10-50 layers can be prepared in a single coating, while successive coats can make films up to 200 layers (about 40 to 140 &mgr;m depending on the diameter of the nanospheres used). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> General Procedure for the Fabrication of Macroporous Polymers Having Ordered, Monodisperse Voids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A simplified graphic of the procedure for producing three-dimensionally ordered, monodisperse macroporous polymers is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The microslide with the first-generation ordered, monodisperse colloidal template on its surface is covered by another microslide and dipped in approximately 1-2 milliliters (ml) of a polymerizable monomer. Capillary forces draw the liquid monomer into the void spaces between the particles of the colloidal template. Filling times range from several seconds for a low viscosity monomer such as styrene to between five and ten minutes for a high viscosity monomer such as NOA 60, trade name for a polyurethane precursor. Due to refractive index matching between silica and monomer, the cell becomes transparent. The prepolymers are then cross-linked thermally at 60&deg; C. or by exposure to UV light (320 W) for several hours. Afterwards one or both microslides are carefully removed and the freestanding polymer film is soaked in an approximately 4% hydrofluoric acid solution (about 15 ml) overnight to remove the silica. The resulting macroporous polymer is air-dried. Depending on the properties of different polymers, the products can be rigid (e.g., PMMA and polystyrene) or flexible (e.g., polyurethane). To form a stronger self-standing macroporous polymer, a 0.1 mm Teflon spacer can be used to separate the two microslides. The films exhibit striking iridescence due to Bragg diffraction of visible light by the ordered air spheres in the polymer. The pore sizes and the thickness of the macroporous polymer film can be controlled by changing the size of the particles comprising the first-generation colloidal template and/or the number of layers in the template. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Ordered, Monodisperse Silica Templates and Ordered, Monodisperse Macroporous Polymers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The present templating method provides a simple and versatile route for the production of macroporous polymers. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> are SEM images of an ordered, monodisperse silica colloidal template and a macroporous polystyrene film, respectively, prepared according to the present invention. The colloidal template depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> was prepared from silica nanospheres having a diameter of 298.6 nm whereas the polystyrene polymer depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> was prepared from a colloidal template comprised of 330.2 nm diameter silica nanospheres. A comparison of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> clearly shows that the high quality features of the silica colloidal template can be effectively translated to polymers so as to form ordered, monodisperse macropores. Moreover, since the template thickness and nanosphere size can be controlled, so can the macroporous structure. Void sizes ranging from 200 to 400 nm in diameter have been achieved, with good thickness uniformity across at least one centimeter in all cases. Monodisperse silica spheres can be made ranging from 20 nm up to several microns in diameter. It is believed that if high quality templates of the larger and smaller silica can be prepared, then void sizes over the entire nanometer size range should be feasible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> An important issue for many applications of macroporous polymer films is that the resulting films must be strong and resistant to cracking. While the mechanical properties have not been quantified here, the present methods allow for the use of any monomer whose resulting polymer is not soluble in the template etchant (e.g., hydrofluoric acid). Thus, glassy polymers (e.g., polystyrene) as well as rubbery polymers (e.g., polyurethane) work equally well in the present invention. Although the first-generation colloidal templates described herein have been studied to a thickness of 50 microns, colloidal templates can be prepared with a thickness of up to 1 millimeter (mm). However, their long-range crystalline order begins to degrade above about 200 microns. While such polycrystalline samples would not be ideal for optical studies, they may be more suitable for other applications requiring macroporous media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Small Interconnected Pores in the Macroporous Polymer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Visualization of the macroporous polymers using SEM reveals that the samples exhibit not only an ordered, monodisperse pore structure from the silica nanospheres, but also a uniform distribution of smaller pores that form around points where the silica nanospheres once touched. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> are SEM top-view images of the inner layers of two macroporous polystyrene membranes made using silica templates with different sphere diameters. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> depicts a polystyrene film prepared from a colloidal template comprised of 260.4 nm diameter silica nanospheres and exhibiting an inner pore diameter of 55.8&plusmn;3.8 nm. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> depicts a polystyrene film prepared from a template comprised of 330.2 nm diameter silica nanospheres and exhibiting an inner pore diameter of 57.9&plusmn;4.3 nm. The similarity of inner pore diameters in these two images despite the significant difference in the sizes of the silica nanospheres evidences the insensitivity of the size of the interconnecting inner pores to the size of the template silica spheres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> These small inner pores may be of utility in non-optical applications, such as size-selective filters or electrophoretic separations media. Given the potential importance of the interconnection pores in separation technologies, experiments were conducted to determine whether and over what range their size could be controlled. From their placement in the larger pores it is apparent that these smaller pores are located where the silica nanospheres were in closest proximity. One possible explanation for their origin is that the initial monomer solution could not wet the silica nanosphere surfaces completely, leading to gaps in its filling of the template. Fluid viscosity is known to be an important factor governing the effective filling of porous materials; more viscous liquids are less able to completely absorb into the available free space due to both wetting and capillary phenomena. Alternatively, polymerization shrinkage could result in the formation of the pores. The three monomers employed in this work undergo approximately twenty to thirty percent volume shrinkage upon polymerization. Because the silica colloidal template is effectively incompressible, thin areas of polymer such as those located between spheres could yield due to shrinkage, thereby forming the smaller pores observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> To evaluate these issues, NOA 60, a particularly viscous monomer, was applied and polymerized at different temperatures. A Fisher Isotemp 2150 circulator and an acrylic open bath were used to control the polymerization temperature of NOA 60. At low temperatures the prepolymers are very viscous and take about five minutes to fill the cell while at high temperatures they are less viscous and fill the cell in several seconds. After allowing the monomer to equilibrate for thirty minutes in the isotemp bath, the monomer was polymerized by exposure to UV light as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The temperature of the initial monomer solution during application and polymerization has a significant effect on the size of the internal pores. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A, 6B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C show top-view SEM images demonstrating that the size of the smaller inner pores in macroporous NOA 60, a commercial polyurethane, could be varied through control of monomer temperature. In each case, a silica colloidal template comprised of 353 nm diameter silica nanospheres was used. At 22.5&deg; C., the NOA 60 monomer was quite viscous and produced inner pores having a diameter of 117.6&plusmn;8.3 nm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>). At 40.0&deg; C. and 70&deg; C., respectively, inner pores of made 90.6&plusmn;6.5 nm and 60.7&plusmn;4.9 nm diameter were produced (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</cross-reference>, respectively). Other parameters, such as the shrinkage of the monomer upon polymerization, as well as its ability to wet the silica surface, had much less effect on the observed morphology. Thus, by adjusting application and polymerization temperature or otherwise controlling the viscosity of the monomer, the size of smaller interconnecting pores can be controlled. Efforts to create smaller pores using very low viscosity monomers, however, were not successful and average inner pore diameters of 50 nm were typical. It may be that this lower limit is indeed the result of polymerization shrinkage. If so, the creation of inner pores whose diameters are smaller than 50 nm will require low shrinkage monomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Optical Properties of Macroporous Polymers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Because of the ordering of the pores within the polymer, the ordered, monodisperse macroporous polymers exhibit diffraction phenomena that lead to striking optical properties. The most prominent is the presence of a strong diffraction peak in the optical spectrum. Certain basic properties of these systems can be described by Bragg&apos;s law. At normal incidence (where sin &thgr;<highlight><subscript>inc</subscript></highlight>&equals;1), the spectral position of the peak in the optical density, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>peak</subscript></highlight>, can be found from: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> where n<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>is the average refractive index of the entire medium (air and polymer) at optical frequencies and d<highlight><subscript>111 </subscript></highlight>is the interlayer spacing of the air spheres along the (111) direction. This spacing is related to the sphere diameter D by d<highlight><subscript>111</subscript></highlight>&equals;{square root}{square root over (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>)} D for any close-packed structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Optical studies of the macroporous polymer films produced illustrate the diffractive properties of the matrix and provide additional evidence of the highly crystalline quality of these samples. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts the optical transmission spectra for three macroporous PMMA polymer films made from silica spheres ranging from 311 to 360 nm in diameter. A small incoherent scattering background was subtracted from this data in order to facilitate comparison with a theoretical model of photonic band gap behavior (dashed lines), described further below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the predicted peak position, speak, as a function of nanosphere diameter. The data in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> are in agreement with a model which assumes a perfect three dimensional lattice of ordered air spheres in a polymer matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> While Bragg&apos;s law explains the spectral position of the peak, a theoretical treatment appropriate to strongly diffracting layers is necessary to provide a quantitative model of the optical spectra. The scalar wave theory developed for periodic dielectric structures can be easily applied to these materials. In short, Maxwell&apos;s equations are solved for a periodic dielectric assuming that one may neglect diffraction from all but one set of crystalline planes-in this case, the (111) planes. While this approximation is not entirely correct, the model is tractable and is appropriate for comparison with normal-incidence transmission spectra. In particular, although this theory always predicts a larger optical density than observed, the predicted spectral bandwidths are in good agreement with observations. Thus, this formalism can be used to evaluate whether the observed bandwidths are controlled by defects in the sample or are intrinsic to the film. In principle, the calculation contains no adjustable parameters, since the size of the nanospheres and the sample thickness are independently determined from SEM measurements, and the refractive index of the polymer is known. However, because of the known difficulties in predicting the magnitude of the peak optical density, an overall multiplicative scaling factor is used. This facilitates comparisons of the measured and calculated bandwidths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The predictions of the scalar wave approximation are compared to experimental data in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The samples used to obtain these data (solid lines) were all thin, on the order of nine to twelve layers. All three theoretical curves (dotted lines) have been scaled by a multiplicative factor of 0.75, but otherwise there are no adjustable parameters. The remarkable agreement between theory and experiment provides evidence that these samples are not highly defective. In addition, the close correlation rules out the possibility that residual silica was left behind. Finally, optical characterization of this type illustrates that the film did not undergo significant dimensional changes during the hydrofluoric acid treatment and thus faithfully reproduced the morphology of the first-generation colloidal template. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the predicted and measured spectral positions of the optical stop bands, as a function of sphere diameter, obtained from data such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The solid line is the prediction from the scalar wave theory, which is nearly identical to that obtained from Bragg&apos;s Law, equation &lsqb;1&rsqb; above, for films thicker than &tilde;20 layers. For reference, the dashed line shows the predicted spectral positions for the colloidal templates&mdash;i.e., &ldquo;normal&rdquo; samples, with silica nanospheres surrounded by air rather than the &ldquo;inverted&rdquo; macroporous samples that represent a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; image of the template. The &tilde;100 nm shift between the two is a result of the substantial decrease in n<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>, resulting from the lower volume fraction occupied by the polymer in the &ldquo;inverted&rdquo; samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> One important issue for many applications is the net void volume, or surface area, in these systems. EDAX analysis of the macroporous polymer films show only trace amounts of silica (less than 0.7%), indicating that the treatment removes almost all of the template. This is not surprising due to the high dissolution rate of silica in aqueous HF (k<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>g SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sec<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>M<highlight><subscript>HF</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>) and the internal connection between silica spheres. Additionally, the predicted optical spectra are highly sensitive to the volume fraction occupied by the polymer. The predictions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> assume that the air spheres are close-packed, and that the polymer fills the remaining approximately twenty-six percent of the total volume. The good agreement with experimental results provides further evidence that the polymer pore structure effectively replicates the morphology of the first-generation colloidal template. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Clearly, these ordered, monodisperse macroporous polymers act as a spectral filter. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the bandwidth of the filter can be tailored by controlling the thickness (number of layers) of the colloidal template. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the width of the spectral filter for a ordered, monodisperse macroporous polystyrene film as a function of the number of layers in the first-generation colloidal template. For a macroporous polystyrene film prepared from a silica template having nine layers, the spectral window is quite broad (approximately 60 nm based on full-width at half-height). This spectral width decreases as the number of layers in the first-generation colloidal template increases. For example, a macroporous polystyrene film prepared from a silica template having fifty layers possesses a much narrower spectral window (approximately 30 nm based on full-width at half-height). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The second-generation ordered, monodisperse colloids of the present invention can be prepared from a variety of materials including ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, metals and their precursors. The method varies in each case depending on the material to be prepared. The general approach, however, is to expose the monodisperse, ordered macroporous polymer film to a precursor of the desired colloidal material, which then infiltrates the pores within the polymer. Then, this precursor material, which deposits in the macropores is condensed to its solid form and the macroporous polymer is removed by, for example, heating or dissolution. The resulting solid then reflects the size, shape and organization of the original macropores. </paragraph>

First, the macroporous polymer is soaked in the precursor solution until it becomes transparent due to the close refractive index match to the alcohol. Next, the film is removed and placed in ultra-pure water (Milli-Q, 18.2 M&OHgr;cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>) for 8 hours followed by drying under nitrogen. As metal oxides begin to form, the film turns slightly hazy. After repeated exposure to the alkoxide solution, followed by immersion in water, the film ultimately becomes opaque. After filling the voids of the macroporous polymers with metal oxides, the polystyrene templates can be dissolved in toluene and PMMA templates can be burned out by propane torch for one minute to release the ordered, monodisperse colloid. The typical size of the synthesized colloid is several square millimeters. To make larger, more robust colloids ideal for optical characterization, a transparent polyurethane thin-film backing can be used to &ldquo;glue&rdquo; the colloids onto glass slides by photopolymerizing the polyurethane precursor NOA 60 for several minutes under an ultraviolet lamp (320 W). To avoid penetration of polyurethane monomers into the voids of the hollow spheres replicated inside polystyrene films, NOA 60 is pre-polymerized for ten seconds under ultraviolet light into a very viscous oligomer before &ldquo;gluing&rdquo; the colloids onto the polyurethane, which can then be completely polymerized. After dissolving the polymer template in toluene, a robust ordered, monodisperse colloid as big as several square centimeters is formed. </paragraph>

The inset of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> depicts the relationship between the shell thickness and the number of coatings. Because the colloids are formed through successive deposition of thin layers of ceramics, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 10C</cross-reference> indicate that shell thickness can be precisely controlled. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</cross-reference> is an SEM image of a solid alumina colloid replicated from a PMMA template. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The nature of the colloid particles formed-hollow or solid-appears to be a function of the polymer used. When macroporous polystyrene serves as the host for colloidal growth, most materials conformally coat the interior polymer pore surface during filling. In these polymers, colloids grow from the outside in and, after thermal treatment and polymer removal, hollow capsules result. A very different process is observed when macroporous PMMA is used as a template. Here, the ceramic layer pulls away from the host polymer and forms solid spheres that are smaller than the cavities. Colloidal formation in this instance proceeds from the center outwards, and colloids grow successively larger after repeated immersion/filling cycles. Other inorganic materials such as CdS and AgCl also show a tendency to adhere strongly to polystyrene but not to PMMA. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Metallic nanospheres and nanoshells are also of interest because of their optical and physical properties, yet they are notoriously difficult to prepare in the 50 to 500 nanometer range by standard chemical methods.

When the sample is compressed prior to imaging as in FIG <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>B, the colloids collapse into irregular shapes, much like deflated basketballs. Existing methods for forming polymer capsules rely on layer-by-layer assembly of polyelectrolytes, or the formation of block co-polymer assemblies, which necessarily limit the choice of polymer materials. In the present method, the only constraint placed on the choice of material is that its polymerization must occur under conditions that do not destroy the macroporous polymer mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Solid poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and Au ordered, monodisperse colloids have also been prepared by filling the macroporous polystyrene films with PPV precursor in methanol solution or gold nanocrystals in hexane solution, respectively. The solvents were slowly evaporated to deposit solids deep inside the pores and the macroporous polystyrene film was removed by dissolution in toluene. The general nature of this physical filling allows the preparation of solid ordered, monodisperse colloids from a large number of other materials, including many available nanocrystals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> To evaluate how effectively the templating process captures the uniformity of the macropores in the polymer, the final particle size and size distribution were measured using SEM images such as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</cross-reference>. These sizes are compared to the characteristics of the starting silica colloids and macroporous polymer voids in Table 1. Over 200 particles were

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> measured in the SEM images to arrive at the values reported. As is observed from Table 1, size distributions remained remarkably narrow after the templating steps. Macroporous polystyrene samples having an average pore diameter of 333 nm templated from silica colloids composed of 336 nm diameter silica nanospheres were used to make all spheres in the middle column, whereas macroporous PMMA samples having an average pore diameter of 288 nm templated from silica colloids composed of 294 nm diameter silica nanospheres were used to make all spheres in the right column. The average diameters of colloids templated from PMMA templates show a roughly ten percent reduction from the diameters of the macropores, which is reasonable given the shrinkage that occurs during the template removal process. Although there are chemical methods for producing some of these colloids with relatively narrow size distributions (around 10 percent), this templating approach provides a strategy for creating a wide range of highly monodisperse colloids (approximately five percent standard deviation in sphere radii). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In addition to providing for a remarkable range of colloidal materials and architectures, the macroporous polymers of the present invention are pliable materials that can be compressed or extended to form unusual void shapes. Several experiments were conducted to determine whether colloids grown in such distorted voids would adopt non-spherical shapes. Non-spherical colloids may offer advantages over their spherical counterparts in applications that require periodic structures with lower symmetries. In addition, monodisperse ellipsoidal latex colloids have been suggested as a potential model for rigid rod systems, such as liquid-crystal polymers and biopolymers. Methods for preparing inorganic, polymeric, and metallic colloidal cubes, ellipsoids, and rods have been reported for specific materials, but sample homogeneity is poor and a general methodology has not yet been developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When a macroporous polymer film is heated above its glass transition temperature (T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>), it becomes rubbery and can be stretched by a uniform uniaxial or biaxial force. The draw ratio, D, characterizes the magnitude of this extension and for one dimensional stretching is defined as the ratio of the extended length to the starting length. To avoid collapse of the voids during the heating, the pores can be filled with mineral oil prior to heating, which is removed by a heptane wash afterwards. If the film is then quickly cooled down below T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>, while still constrained in the deformed state, the shape of the stretched voids, oblate for a two-dimensional extension and ellipsoidal for a one-dimensional extension, is fixed into the glassy, inflexible polymer. These non-spherical voids can be replicated into many different materials using the same methods described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference> show top-view SEM images of two hollow ellipsoidal titania colloids with different axial ratios (p), both templated from macroporous polystyrene (Tg&equals;94&deg; C.). The ellipsoidal shapes of the colloids and the long-range order in the (111) plane are confirmed by the elongated hexagonal patterns of the FFTs (insets of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference>). The lengths of both the long axis and the short axis of these ellipsoidal colloids made with differing draw ratios (D<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>&equals;1.3 and D<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>&equals;1.7) were measured. The sample in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> has a 489&plusmn;27 nm long axis, a 333&plusmn;18 nm short axis, and an axial ratio of 1.47; the sample in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference> has a 624&plusmn;43 nm long axis, a 281&plusmn;14 nm short axis and an axial ratio of 2.22. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Using the method described, a high degree of control over the aspect ratio of the resulting colloids can be achieved. The axial ratios (p) of ellipsoidal samples can be predicted from their corresponding draw ratios (D) by assuming the volume of the voids does not change during the stretch; this assumption is reasonable since the voids are filled with mineral oil, which is not likely to undergo a significant change in density as a result of the modest forces during extension. A brief analysis reveals that the axial ratio of the particles, p, can be related to the draw ratio, D, through: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>p&equals;b/a&equals;D</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>3/2</superscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;&lsqb;5&rsqb;</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> where b and a are the lengths of the long and short axis of the ellipsoidal colloids, respectively. The measured axial ratios of four ellipsoidal samples with differing draw ratios shown in the left inset of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference> agree well with this simple model. A similar result has also been observed in a polystyrene latex/poly(vinyl alcohol) system. Axial ratios greater than 5.0 are not feasible as the polymer begins to tear as a result of the tensile force. The use of more flexible polymers such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) may alleviate this issue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The ordering perpendicular to the close-packed (111) axis of these elliptical colloids is apparent in the cross-sectional SEM image in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C, which is taken from the same sample imaged in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference>. The sample templated from polystyrene is hollow as shown by the broken colloids in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C and further confirmed by the TEM image in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</cross-reference>. The ellipsoids are monodisperse with a uniform shell thickness. Thus, heating and stretching does not change the surface properties of the polymer substantially, so all of the morphologies and materials developed for the non-stretched templates can be extended to these non-spherical examples. Ellipsoidal ordered, monodisperse colloids with high refractive index may pave the way for building new photonic crystals with superior optical properties because geometric anisotropy has been shown to widen the photonic band gap of colloidal materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Deconstructing the Ordered, Monodisperse Colloids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Ultrasonication is a well-established method for breaking up colloidal aggregates in solution, and it was used successfully to fragment these colloidal films. Brief treatments (30s in a 40 W ultrasonic bath) in solvents such as toluene yielded larger colloidal fragments (several millimeters in size), which were ideal specimens for TEM studies of the array geometry depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</cross-reference>. Longer treatments, up to ten minutes, provided dispersed material of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>. The dispersed colloids exhibit uniform surfaces. While the geometry of the macroporous host contains windows between the spherical voids, colloidal material does not appear to template these channels at any significant density. This can be attributed to the relative size of the windows, which is only ten to twenty percent of the pore size, and to the colloidal shrinkage induced during the condensation or polymerization reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Except for ultrasonication in appropriate solvents, the second-generation ordered, monodisperse colloids are remarkably robust, high-quality materials. Their long-range order is apparent in SEM images, such as that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. A fast-Fourier transform (FFT) of the image provides a measure of order in the (111) plane (inset of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) and it is apparent that the spheres are arranged in a close-packed array. Although defects such as cracks and point defects can be observed, the single crystalline nature of the starting silica colloid is clearly retained during the templating process. The ordering perpendicular to the close-packed (111) axis is best visualized in cross-sectional images, such as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</cross-reference> depicting an ordered, monodisperse colloid composed of solid alumina spheres. These samples are films, not monoliths, and their (111) axis is perpendicular to the underlying glass substrate. The film thickness can be precisely controlled from single monolayers to over 100 layers due to the faithful replication of the starting silica ordered, monodisperse colloid. Because of their long range order, these samples possess a photonic stop-band comparable to that seen in macroporous titania. The spectral position and width of this band for hollow titania colloids depends sensitively on the shell thickness and on the overlap between adjacent spheres. Thus hollow spheres offer another two new parameters, namely shell thickness and aspect ratio, for engineering photonic properties in colloidal systems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> All publications and patent applications herein are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Transgenic crops and the application of biotechnology are dramatically altering seed and agrochemical businesses throughout the world. The seeds of commercially important crops have been genetically engineered to be resistant to herbicides and pests, especially insect pests. According to surveys by the United States Department of Agriculture (June, 2000), genetically modified corn, soybeans and cotton were grown on approximately 25%, 54% and 61%, respectively, of the total U.S. acres for each crop in 2000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The uncontrolled transmission of heterologous traits in commercially important crop plants is currently a major concern throughout the world and especially within the agricultural community. The undesired dissemination of transgenic pollen may unintentionally harm beneficial insects and may result in the spread of transgenes to related plant species leading to the contamination of food products and the production of herbicide- and pesticide-resistant weedy species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The biotechnology industry is interested in transferring traits such as tolerances to drought, insects, diseases, salinity, frost and herbicides into cultivated plants which might confer an adaptive advantage over wild plants. Several crop species are known to be cross-compatible with wild species and it is possible that these traits could be inadvertently transferred to wild weedy relatives through sexual hybridization leading to possible economic and ecological harm. Since most forage and turf grasses have undergone relatively little domestication and may even be considered weeds in certain instances (e.g., bermudagrass), there is a high probability of greater problems in the ultimate release and use of such genetically transformed plants. Because forage grasses, in general, are not highly domesticated, possess weedy characteristics, and are highly outcrossing, special difficulties may be encountered in the ultimate release of transgenic forage grasses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It would be highly desirable to have a method to prevent the undesired transmission of heterologous traits in commercially important crop plants. If this could be achieved, genetic leakage of heterologous traits would be brought under control and the spread of these traits to undesired recipients would be curtailed. Thus, the need exits for a genetic system that selects against male or female gametophytes containing transgenes, thereby preventing, eliminating or reducing the undesired transmission of heterologous traits. In particular, there is a need for a genetic system which allows for the transmission of non-transgenic (i.e., wild type) gametophytes while preventing the transmission of the transgenic (i.e., heterologous) gametophytes from the same plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, an object of this invention is to provide recombinant nucleic acid constructs and methods for controlling, reducing or eliminating the undesired transmission of heterologous traits in commercially important crop plants. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The instant invention is directed to genetic constructs and methods for controlling the spread of heterologous traits in plants. Control is achieved by providing a sex-specific promoter operably linked to a suicide gene that selects against male or female gametes containing the suicide gene. The suicide gene locus is termed the &ldquo;gametophytic suicide trait&rdquo; (GST) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). By linking a transgene of interest to a suicide gene under the control of a sex-specific promoter, transmission of the transgene to progeny is effectively eliminated, reduced or prevented because no gametes bearing the GST will be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention can be said to broadly consist of a suicide gene under the control of a pollen-specific promoter linked to a transgene of interest. The transgene complex can be introduced into a virgin plant genome and plants can be selected which are hemizygous for the transgene complex. The only pollen produced by the hemizygous plant will lack the transgene complex due to its physical linkage to the suicide gene. Uncontrolled spread of the heterologous trait encoded by the transgene complex is thereby prevented because no pollen containing the transgene complex is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A second aspect of the invention is based on placing the GST in close proximity to a transposon to produce selective enrichment of dispersed transposition events in progeny cells since only those gametes lacking the GST locus will be viable. Since a fraction of the progeny cells produced from viable gametes will have undergone transposition events, selective enrichment of dispersed transposition events is achieved because the transposon is necessarily no longer linked to the GST (the GST destroys those gametes that inherit the GST gene locus) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention provides genetic systems which can be used for the elimination of a GST transgene complex and for the selection for unlinked transpositions. By using the GST together with any transgene, one can completely eliminate male (or female in the case of a female gametophytic-specific promoter:suicide construct) transmission of both the GST and the associated transgene (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;female&rdquo; refers to a plant that produces ovules. Female plants generally produce seeds after fertilization. A plant designated as a &ldquo;female plant&rdquo; may contain both male and female sexual organs. Alternatively, the &ldquo;female plant&rdquo; may only contain female sexual organs either naturally (e.g., in dioecious species) or due to emasculation (e.g., by detasselling). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;filial generation&rdquo; refers to any of the generations of cells, tissues or organisms following a particular parental generation. The generation resulting from a mating of the parents is the first filial generation (designated as &ldquo;F1&rdquo; or &ldquo;F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;), while that resulting from crossing of F1 individuals is the second filial generation (designated as &ldquo;F2&rdquo; or &ldquo;F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;gamete&rdquo; refers to a reproductive cell whose nucleus (and often cytoplasm) fuses with that of another gamete of similar origin but of opposite sex to form a zygote, which has the potential to develop into a new individual. Gametes are haploid and are differentiated into male and female. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;gene&rdquo; refers to any segment of DNA associated with a biological function. Thus, genes include, but are not limited to, coding sequences and/or the regulatory sequences required for their expression. Genes can also include nonexpressed DNA segments that, for example, form recognition sequences for other proteins. Genes can be obtained from a variety of sources, including cloning from a source of interest or synthesizing from known or predicted sequence information, and may include sequences designed to have desired parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;genotype&rdquo; refers to the genetic makeup of an individual cell, cell culture, tissue, plant, or group of plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;hemizygous&rdquo; refers to a cell, tissue or organism in which a gene is present only once in a genotype, as a gene in a haploid cell or organism, a sex-linked gene in the heterogametic sex, or a gene in a segment of chromosome in a diploid cell or organism where its partner segment has been deleted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;heterologous polynucleotide&rdquo; or a &ldquo;heterologous nucleic acid&rdquo; or an &ldquo;exogenous DNA segment&rdquo; refers to a polynucleotide, nucleic acid or DNA segment that originates from a source foreign to the particular host cell, or, if from the same source, is modified from its original form. Thus, a heterologous gene in a host cell includes a gene that is endogenous to the particular host cell, but has been modified. Thus, the terms refer to a DNA segment which is foreign or heterologous to the cell, or homologous to the cell but in a position within the host cell nucleic acid in which the element is not ordinarily found. Exogenous DNA segments are expressed to yield exogenous polypeptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;heterologous trait&rdquo; refers to a phenotype imparted to a transformed host cell or transgenic organism by an exogenous DNA segment, heterologous polynucleotide or heterologous nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;heterozygote&rdquo; refers to a diploid or polyploid individual cell or plant having different alleles (forms of a given gene) present at least at one locus. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; refers to any individual cell, tissue or plant resulting from a cross between parents that differ in one or more genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;inbred&rdquo; or &ldquo;inbred line&rdquo; refers to a relatively true-breeding strain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;line&rdquo; is used broadly to include, but is not limited to, a group of plants vegetatively propagated from a single parent plant, via tissue culture techniques or a group of inbred plants which are genetically very similar due to descent from a common parent(s). A plant is said to &ldquo;belong&rdquo; to a particular line if it (a) is a primary transformant (T0) plant regenerated from material of that line; (b) has a pedigree comprised of a T0 plant of that line; or (c) is genetically very similar due to common ancestry (e.g., via inbreeding or selfing). In this context, the term &ldquo;pedigree&rdquo; denotes the lineage of a plant, e.g. in terms of the sexual crosses effected such that a gene or a combination of genes, in heterozygous (hemizygous) or homozygous condition, imparts a desired trait to the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;locus&rdquo; (plural: &ldquo;loci&rdquo;) refers to any site that has been defined genetically. A locus may be a gene, or part of a gene, or a DNA sequence that has some regulatory role, and may be occupied by different sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;male&rdquo; refers to a plant that produces pollen grains. The &ldquo;male plant&rdquo; generally refers to the sex that produces gametes for fertilizing ova. A plant designated as a &ldquo;male plant&rdquo; may contain both male and female sexual organs. Alternatively, the &ldquo;male plant&rdquo; may only contain male sexual organs either naturally (e.g., in dioecious species) or due to emasculation (e.g., by removing the ovary). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;mass selection&rdquo; refers to a form of selection in which individual plants are selected and the next generation propagated from the aggregate of their seeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;nucleic acid&rdquo; or &ldquo;polynucleotide&rdquo; refer to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the terms encompass nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides that have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g. degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al. (1991) Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081; Ohtsuka et al. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608; Cassol et al. (1992); Rossolini et al. (1994) Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98). The term nucleic acid is used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, and mRNA encoded by a gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a DNA segment is referred to as &ldquo;operably linked&rdquo; when it is placed into a functional relationship with another DNA segment. For example, DNA for a signal sequence is operably linked to DNA encoding a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it stimulates the transcription of the sequence. Generally, DNA sequences that are operably linked are contiguous, and in the case of a signal sequence both contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers need not be contiguous with the coding sequences whose transcription they control. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites or at adapters or linkers inserted in lieu thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;open pollination&rdquo; refers to a plant population that is freely exposed to some gene flow, as opposed to a closed one in which there is an effective barrier to gene flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;open-pollinated population&rdquo; or &ldquo;open-pollinated variety&rdquo; refer to plants normally capable of at least some cross-fertilization, selected to a standard, that may show variation but that also have one or more genotypic or phenotypic characteristics by which the population or the variety can be differentiated from others. A hybrid, which has no barriers to cross-pollination, is an open-pollinated population or an open-pollinated variety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;ovule&rdquo; refers to the female gametophyte, whereas the term &ldquo;pollen&rdquo; means the male gametophyte. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Overview of the Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Constructs and methods are described for the destruction of the male or female gametophyte (microspores or megaspores) for the purposes of eliminating transmission of a transgene locus (gene of interest). In one embodiment, microspore destruction is genetically engineered using a pollen-specific promoter fused to an appropriate suicide gene or through the use of genetic mutations that are unable to be transmitted through one of the sexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> When hemizygous, eliminating transmission of a transgene locus is achieved by linking a gene of interest to a suicide gene under the control of a male or female-specific promoter. This construct, termed the &ldquo;gametophytic suicide trait&rdquo; (GST) induces cell death that is restricted to microspores or megaspores, thereby effectively reducing or eliminating transmission of the gene of interest that is linked to the GST. Since the GST/transgene construct is hemizygous, 50% of the pollen grains will be viable and non-transgenic. Thus, the transmission of a transgene can be controlled while permitting pollination to occur so as to achieve fertilization and ultimately obtain a seed supply for planting or food use. Since many plants produce an over-abundance of pollen, the loss of 50% of the pollen produced will not adversely affect seed set for most plant species. As one example, corn (Zea mays) produces as many as 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>pollen grains/day for a plant in the peak of a 7 day flowering period (Coe et al., The Genetics of Corn, In: Corn and Corn Improvement. Third Edition. Editors: Sprague et al., (1988) pp. 81-258). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Eliminating male transmission of a transgene locus can also be used as a novel strategy to enrich for dispersed and/or stable transposition events. This is accomplished by engineering a &ldquo;transgene complex&rdquo; containing a transposable element and/or transposase gene along with a &ldquo;gametophytic suicide trait&rdquo; (GST). The GST induces cell death that is restricted to microspores, severely reducing male transmission of nearby chromosomal regions and other transgenes, including the transposon (donor element) and/or transposase gene within the transgene complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> When the transgene complex is heterozygous in the male parent, approximately 50% of the microspores will undergo destruction, thereby preventing male transmission of the transgene complex and greatly reducing male transmission of linked transposed elements. This elimination of the transposon donor site and nearby transpositions has the net effect of enriching for pollen containing unlinked transpositions and transposed elements that have recombined with the donor transgene complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Surviving transposition events can be readily selected in offspring by including an herbicide selectable marker gene within the transposable element. The GST can also be physically linked to the transposase source to eliminate gametes containing a source of transposase. This arrangement prevents transmission of the transposase source to gametes, thereby stabilizing insertions in subsequent generations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> All three components&mdash;the suicide gene or mutation, the transposase source and the transposon&mdash;can be engineered as a unit to provide a robust method of generating dispersed, stable transpositions. An alternative strategy to microspore destruction is to engineer ovule semi-sterility using a megaspore suicide trait to eliminate female transmission of the transgene complex. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> For the present invention, any promoter will be suitable if the promoter is specific to one sex (male or female) and specifically drives gene expression after meiosis I when homologous chromosomes have separated into different cells. For instance, gene expression in the tetrad stage of meiosis II, the post-mitotic division of the microspore leading to pollen maturation, the mature pollen grain, or in the germinating pollen grain, would be suitable for the current invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the gametophytic suicide trait (GST) is the directed expression of a suicide gene to kill unwanted meiotic products. Examples of genes whose expression results in cell death include, but are not limited to, those that have been described in the literature including the barnase (Custers, J. B., et al., (1997) Plant Mol Biol Vol. 35/6:689-99; Yazynin, S., et al., (1999) FEBS Lett Vol. 452/3:351-4; Goldman, M. H, et al., (1994) Embo J Vol. 13/13:2976-84, 1994), tasselseed2 (DeLong, A, et al., (1993) Cell Vol. 74/4:757-768), and the diptheria toxin A gene (Day, C. D., et al., (1995) Development Vol. 121/9:2887-95). Because suicide gene expression is confined to post-meiosis I, only 50% of the gametes will be eliminated when the transgene is hemizygous and segregates normally in meiosis. Viable gametes will not have inherited the suicide gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, semi-sterility can also be achieved using antisense RNA technology to inhibit expression of a gene, or genes, essential for viability of the pollen or egg. This technology is discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, mutations that are incapable of transmission through one of the sexes, such as deletions that are not pollen transmitted, can also be used to achieve semi-sterility. </paragraph>

Genetic and molecular evidence shows that ts2 is required for pistil elimination in both tassel and ear spikelets. ts2 expression in pistil cells is coincident with loss of nuclear integrity and cell death. It is not clear how the ts2 gene product functions in a cell death pathway. On the basis of its similarity to short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases, especially to hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, two possibilities are theorized. The ts2 product may metabolize a substrate, perhaps a steroid, required for cell viability. Alternatively, TS2 action may result in the formation of a signaling molecule that activates a cell death response. (Calderon-Urrea et al. (1999) Development, 126:435). </paragraph>

See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,940,835 to Shah et al., which discloses the nucleotide sequence of a form of EPSP which can confer glyphosate resistance. A DNA molecule encoding a mutant aroA gene can be obtained under ATCC accession No. 39256, and the nucleotide sequence of the mutant gene is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,061 to Comai. European patent application No. 0 333 033 to Kumada et al. and U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> D. Site-Specific Recombination Systems </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Methods and constructs for targeting of DNA sequences for insertion into a particular DNA locus, while enabling removal of randomly inserted DNA sequences that occur as a by-product of transformation procedures, are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,527,695 and 6,114,600. One manner of removing these random insertions is to utilize a site-specific recombinase system. In general, a site-specific recombinase system consists of three elements: two pairs of DNA sequence (the site-specific recombination sequences) and a specific enzyme (the site-specific recombinase). The site-specific recombinase will catalyze a recombination reaction only between two site-specific recombination sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> A number of different site-specific recombinase systems can be used, including but not limited to the Cre/lox system of bacteriophage P1, the FLP/FRT system of yeast, the Gin recombinase of phage Mu, the Pin recombinase of <highlight><italic>E. coli, </italic></highlight>and the R/RS system of the pSR1 plasmid. The two preferred site-specific recombinase systems are the bacteriophage P1 Cre/lox and the yeast FLP/FRT systems. In these systems a recombinase (Cre or FLP) will interact specifically with its respective site-specific recombination sequence (lox or FRT respectively) to invert or excise the intervening sequences. The sequence for each of these two systems is relatively short (34 bp for lox and 47 bp for FRT). Currently the FLP/FRT system of yeast is the preferred site-specific recombinase system since it normally functions in a eukaryotic organism (yeast), and is well characterized. It is thought that the eukaryotic origin of the FLP/FRT system allows the FLP/FRT system to function more efficiently in eukaryotic cells than the prokaryotic site-specific recombinase systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The FLP/FRT recombinase system has been demonstrated to function efficiently in plant cells. Experiments on the performance of the FLP/FRT system in both maize and rice protoplasts indicates that FRT site structure, and amount of the FLP protein present, affects excision activity. In general, short incomplete FRT sites leads to higher accumulation of excision products than the complete full-length FRT sites. Site-specific recombination systems can catalyze both intra- and intermolecular reactions in maize protoplasts, indicating that the system can be used for DNA excision as well as integration reactions. The recombination reaction is reversible and this reversibility can compromise the efficiency of the reaction in each direction. Altering the structure of the site-specific recombination sequences is one approach to remedying this situation. The site-specific recombination sequence can be mutated in a manner that the product of the recombination reaction is no longer recognized as a substrate for the reverse reaction, thereby stabilizing the integration or excision event. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Expression Units to Express Exogenous DNA in a Plant </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> As provided above, several embodiments of the present invention employ expression units (or expression vectors or systems) to express an exogenously supplied nucleic acid sequence in a plant. Methods for generating expression units/systems/vectors for use in plants are well known in the art and can readily be adapted for use in the instant invention. A skilled artisan can readily use any appropriate plant/vector/expression system in the present methods following the outline provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The expression control elements used to regulate the expression of the protein can either be the expression control element that is normally found associated with the coding sequence (homologous expression element) or can be a heterologous expression control element. A variety of homologous and heterologous expression control elements are known in the art and can readily be used to make expression units for use in the present invention. Transcription initiation regions, for example, can include any of the various opine initiation regions, such as octopine, mannopine, nopaline and the like that are found in the Ti plasmids of Agrobacterium tumafacians. Alternatively, plant viral promoters can also be used, such as the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter to control gene expression in a plant. Lastly, plant promoters such as prolifera promoter, fruit-specific promoters, Ap3 promoter, heat shock promoters, seed-specific promoters, etc. can also be used. The most preferred promoters will be most active in male or female gametes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Either a gamete-specific promoter, a constitutive promoter (such as the CaMV or Nos promoter), an organ-specific promoter (such as the E8 promoter from tomato) or an inducible promoter is typically ligated to the protein or antisense encoding region using standard techniques known in the art. The expression unit may be further optimized by employing supplemental elements such as transcription terminators and/or enhancer elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Thus, for expression in plants, the expression units will typically contain, in addition to the protein sequence, a plant promoter region, a transcription initiation site and a transcription termination sequence. Unique restriction enzyme sites at the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends of the expression unit are typically included to allow for easy insertion into a preexisting vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In the construction of heterologous promoter/structural gene or antisense combinations, the promoter is preferably positioned about the same distance from the heterologous transcription start site as it is from the transcription start site in its natural setting. As is known in the art, however, some variation in this distance can be accommodated without loss of promoter function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In addition to a promoter sequence, the expression cassette can also contain a transcription termination region downstream of the structural gene to provide for efficient termination. The termination region may be obtained from the same gene as the promoter sequence or may be obtained from different genes. If the mRNA encoded by the structural gene is to be efficiently processed, DNA sequences which direct polyadenylation of the RNA are also commonly added to the vector construct. Polyadenylation sequences include, but are not limited to the Agrobacterium octopine synthase signal (Gielen et al., EMBO J. 3:835-846 (1984)) or the nopaline synthase signal (Depicker et al., Mol. and Appl. Genet. 1:561-573 (1982)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The resulting expression unit is ligated into or otherwise constructed to be included in a vector that is appropriate for higher plant transformation. The vector will also typically contain a selectable marker gene by which transformed plant cells can be identified in culture. Usually, the marker gene will encode antibiotic resistance. These markers include resistance to G418, hygromycin, bleomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin. After transforming the plant cells, those cells having the vector will be identified by their ability to grow on a medium containing the particular antibiotic. Replication sequences, of bacterial or viral origin, are generally also included to allow the vector to be cloned in a bacterial or phage host, preferably a broad host range prokaryotic origin of replication is included. A selectable marker for bacteria should also be included to allow selection of bacterial cells bearing the desired construct. Suitable prokaryotic selectable markers also include resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, kanamycin or tetracycline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Other DNA sequences encoding additional functions may also be present in the vector, as is known in the art. For instance, in the case of Agrobacterium transformations, T-DNA sequences will also be included for subsequent transfer to plant chromosomes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The sequences of the present invention can also be fused to various other nucleic acid molecules such as Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs), epitopes or fluorescent protein markers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> ESTs are gene fragments, typically 300 to 400 nucleotides in length, sequenced from the 3&prime; or 5&prime; end of complementary-DNA (cDNA) clones. Nearly 30,000 Arabidopsis thaliana ESTs have been produced by a French and an American consortium (Delseny et al., FEBS Lett. 405(2):129-132 (1997); Arabidopsis thaliana Database, http://genome.www.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis).

<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Biologically compatible fluorescent protein probes, particularly the self-assembling green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish <highlight><italic>Aequorea Victoria, </italic></highlight>have revolutionized research in cell, molecular and developmental biology because they allow visualization of biochemical events in living cells (Murphy et al., Curr. Biol. 7(11):870-876 (1997); Grebenok et al., Plant J. 11(3):573-586 (1997); Pang et al., Plant Physiol 112(3) (1996); Chiu et al., Curr.

<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to develop a more soluble version of the codon-modified GFP called soluble-modified GFP (smGFP). When introduced into Arabidopsis, greater fluorescence was observed when compared to the codon-modified GFP, implying that smGFP is &lsquo;brighter&rsquo; because more of it is present in a soluble and functional form (Davis et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 36(4):521-528 (1998)). By fusing genes encoding GFP and beta-glucuronidase (GUS), researchers were able to create a set of bifunctional reporter constructs which are optimized for use in transient and stable expression systems in plants, including Arabidopsis (Quaedvlieg et al., Plant Mol.

<heading lvl="1">Disabling Genes </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> An example of an effective disabling modification would be a single nucleotide deletion occurring at the beginning of a gene that would produce a translational reading frameshift. Such a frameshift would disable the gene, resulting in non-expressible gene product and thereby disrupting functional protein production by that gene. If the unmodified gene encodes a protease, for example, protease production by the gene could be disrupted if the regulatory regions or the coding regions of the protease gene are disrupted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In addition to disabling genes by deleting nucleotides, causing a transitional reading frameshift, disabling modifications would also be possible by other techniques including insertions, substitutions, inversions or transversions of nucleotides within the gene&apos;s DNA that would effectively prevent the formation of the protein encoded by the DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> It is also within the capabilities of one skilled in the art to disable genes by the use of less specific methods. Examples of less specific methods would be the use of chemical mutagens such as hydroxylamine or nitrosoguanidine or the use of radiation mutagens such as gamma radiation or ultraviolet radiation to randomly mutate genes. Such mutated strains could, by chance, contain disabled genes such that the genes were no longer capable of producing finctional proteins for any one or more of the domains. The presence of the desired disabled genes could be detected by routine screening techniques. For further guidance, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,538. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Antisense Encoding Vectors </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Methods for inhibiting expression in plants using antisense constructs, including generation of antisense sequences in situ are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,107,065; 5,254,800; 5,356,799; 5,728,926; and 6,184,439. The later two patents being entitled: &ldquo;Antisense gene systems of pollination control for hybrid seed production&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Other methods that can be used to inhibit expression of an endogenous gene in a plant may also be used in the present methods. For example, formation of a triple helix at an essential region of a duplex gene serves this purpose. The triplex code, permitting design of the proper single stranded participant is also known in the art. (See H. E. Moser, et al., Science 238:645-650 (1987) and M. Cooney, et al., Science 241:456-459 (1988)). Regions in the control sequences containing stretches of purine bases are particularly attractive targets. Triple helix formation along with photocrosslinking is described, e.g., in D. Praseuth, et al., Proc. Nat&apos;l Acad. Sci. USA 85:1,349-1,353 (1988). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> A. Plant Transformation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> To introduce a desired gene or set of genes by conventional methods requires a sexual cross between two lines, and then repeated back-crossing between hybrid offspring and one of the parents until a plant with the desired characteristics is obtained. This process, however, is restricted to plants that can sexually hybridize, and genes in addition to the desired gene will be transferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Recombinant DNA techniques allow plant researchers to circumvent these limitations by enabling plant geneticists to identify and clone specific genes for desirable traits, such as resistance to an insect pest, and to introduce these genes into already useful varieties of plants. Once the foreign genes have been introduced into a plant, that plant can than be used in conventional plant breeding schemes (e.g., pedigree breeding, single-seed-descent breeding schemes, reciprocal recurrent selection) to produce progeny which also contain the gene of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Genes can be introduced in a site directed fashion using homologous recombination. Homologous recombination permits site-specific modifications in endogenous genes and thus inherited or acquired mutations may be corrected, and/or novel alterations may be engineered into the genome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Homologous recombination and site-directed integration in plants are discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,451,513; 5,501,967 and 5,527,695. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Methods of producing transgenic plants are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Transgenic plants can now be produced by a variety of different transformation methods including, but not limited to, electroporation; microinjection; microprojectile bombardment, also known as particle acceleration or biolistic bombardment; viral-mediated transformation; and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,405,765; 5,472,869; 5,538,877; 5,538,880; 5,550,318; 5,641,664; 5,736,369 and 5,736369; Watson et al., Recombinant DNA, Scientific American Books (1992); Hinchee et al., Bio/Tech. 6:915-922 (1988); McCabe et al., Bio/Tech. 6:923-926 (1988); Toriyama et al., Bio/Tech. 6:1072-1074 (1988); Fromm et al., Bio/Tech. 8:833-839 (1990); Mullins et al., Bio/Tech. 8:833-839 (1990); and, Raineri et al., Bio/Tech. 8:33-38 (1990)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Transgenic alfalfa plants have been produced by many of these methods including, but not limited to, agrobacterium-mediated transformation (Wang et al., Australian Journal of Plant Physiology 23(3):265-270 (1996); Hoffman et al., Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions 10(3):307-315 (1997); Trieu et al., Plant Cell Reports 16:6-11 (1996)) and particle acceleration (U.S. Pat. No. 5,324,646). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Transformation has also been successfully accomplished in clover using agrobacterium-mediated transformation (Voisey et al., Biocontrol Science and Technology 4(4):475-481 (1994); Quesbenberry et al., Crop Science 36(4):1045-1048(1996); Khan Plant Physiology 105(1):81-88 (1994); Voisey et al., Plant Cell Reports 13(6):309-314 (1999)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Genetic transformation has also been reported in numerous forage and turfgrass species (Conger B. V. Genetic Transformation of Forage Grasses in Molecular and Cellular Technologies for Forage Improvement, CSSA Special Publication No. 26, Crop Science Society of America, Inc. E. C. Brummer et al. Eds. 1998, pages 49-58). These include orchardgrass (<highlight><italic>Dactylis glomerata </italic></highlight>L.), tall fescue (<highlight><italic>Festuca arundinacea </italic></highlight>Schreb.) red fescue (<highlight><italic>Festuca rubra </italic></highlight>L.), meadow fescue (<highlight><italic>Festuca pratensis </italic></highlight>Huds.) perennial ryegrass (<highlight><italic>Lolium perenne </italic></highlight>L.) creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds.) and redtop (<highlight><italic>Agrostis alba </italic></highlight>L.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Successful gene transfer in such forages and turfgrasses has been accomplished by direct uptake of DNA by protoplasts and by bombardment of cells or tissues with DNA coated microprojectiles. In both cases, the transfer is followed by whole plant regeneration. Much of the work has focused on developing and improving protocols for the transformation and have used the reporter gene uidA coding for&mdash;glucouronidase (GUS) and the selectable marker bar that confers tolerance to phosphinothricin-based herbicides. Proof of the transformation has been provided by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, northern hybridization analysis of transcribed RNA, western blot analysis of soluble protein (gene product), and southern blot hybridization of total genomic DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> III. Hemizvgosity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> A transgenic plant formed using Agrobacterium transformation methods typically contains a single gene on one chromosome, although multiple copies are possible. Such transgenic plants can be referred to as being hemizygous for the added gene. A more accurate name for such a plant is an independent segregant, because each transformed plant represents a unique T-DNA integration event (U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,953). A transgene locus is generally characterized by the presence and/or absence of the transgene. A heterozygous genotype in which one allele corresponds to the absence of the transgene is also designated hemizygous (U.S. Pat. No. 6,008,437). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Assuming normal hemizygosity, selfing will result in maximum genotypic segregation in the first selfed recombinant generation, also known as the R1 or R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>generation. The R1 generation is produced by selfing the original recombinant line, also known as the R0 or R<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>generation. Because each insert acts as a dominant allele, in the absence of linkage and assuming only one hemizygous insert is required for tolerance expression, one insert would segregate 3:1, two inserts, 15:1, three inserts, 63:1, etc. Therefore, relatively few R1 plants need to be grown to find at least one resistance phenotype (U.S. Pat. Nos.5,436,175 and 5,776,760). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, self-pollination of a hemizygous transgenic regenerated plant should produce progeny equivalent to an F2 in which approximately 25% should be homozygous transgenic plants. Self-pollination and testcrossing of the F2 progeny to non-transformed control plants can be used to identify homozygous transgenic plants and to maintain the line. If the progeny initially obtained for a regenerated plant were from cross pollination, then identification of homozygous transgenic plants will require an additional generation of self-pollination (U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,545). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> IV. Semi-Sterility and Genetic Sterility Filter </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> A. The Gametophytic Sterility Trait (GST) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The GST can be composed of two or three elements: a sex-specific promoter, a suicide gene and, optionally, a region encoding a transposon and/or transposase. Normally, the GST construct ends in a transcription terminator element. The inclusion of a transposon or a transposase source is specific to the application of selecting for dispersed transpositions and not necessarily used for the purposes of eliminating transmission of transgenes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Sex-specific promoters that may be used include but are not limited to: pollen-specific promoters from maize, rice, tomato, tobacco, Arabidopsis and Brassica. Several other examples can be found in GenBank. The promoter must be specific to one sex (male or female) and specifically drive gene expression after meiosis I when homologous chromosomes have separated into different cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The suicide gene is used to kill unwanted meiotic products. Suicide genes include but are not limited to: barnase, tasselseed2 and the diphtheria toxin A gene. Two alternatives to using a suicide gene include 1) using antisense RNA technology to inhibit expression of genes essential to the viability of the pollen or the egg; or 2) mutations that are incapable of transmission through one of the sexes, such as deletions that are not pollen-transmitted. Both of these alternatives can be used to achieve semi-sterility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> B. Semi-Sterility and Genetic Sterility Filter </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;semi-sterility&rdquo; and &ldquo;genetic sterility filter&rdquo; are used by the inventors to convey the idea that since suicide gene expression is confined to post-meiosis I, only 50% of gametes will be eliminated when the GST locus is hemizygous and segregates normally in meiosis. This is due to the fact that when the GST locus is present in the genome in a single copy (hemizygous condition), the suicide gene will be transmitted to approximately one-half of the products of meiosis, resulting in a 50% sterility rate. Pollen inheriting the GST will not survive if a pollen specific promoter is operably linked to the suicide gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The production of 50% viable pollen is necessary for the recovery of dispersed transpositions and/or to prevent transgene transmission without a major effect on male fertility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> C. Gametophytic Semi-Sterility </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The current invention describes the use of a technology that utilizes gametophytic &ldquo;semi-sterility&rdquo;, such as pollen semi-sterility, to generate a &ldquo;genetic sterility filter&rdquo; that eliminates gametes that inherit a specific transgene complex. Incorporation of a pollen-specific promoter into the GST prevents the transmission of transgenes linked to the GST in pollen inheriting this transgene complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> This transgene complex may also contain a launching site for a transposable element and/or transposase gene. In this case, the elimination of the transgene complex, along with the transposon donor site and/or transposase, has the net effect of eliminating nearby transpositions while enriching for transposition events that have recombined with the transgene complex or that are dispersed (no longer linked to the GST) throughout a genome. This methodology overcomes several current limitations of transposon mutagenesis strategies that favors mostly localized over dispersed transpositions. The invention greatly improves on the current use of negative selectable markers to achieve transposon dispersion (Sundaresan, V., et al., (1995) Genes Dev. 9/14:1797-810; Tissier, A. F. et al., (1999) The Plant Cell Vol. 11:1841-1852). Moreover, the use of the genetic sterility filter to eliminate transmission of a transposase source stabilizes the newly transposed elements in progeny, thereby eliminating somatic or secondary transposition events that hamper mutation identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The nature of the semi-sterility trait and its associated transposon and/or transposase, may differ in details depending on the choice of suicide genes, promoters, transposon systems, and species. It is emphasized, however, that the same basic technology of semi-sterility can be used to recover transpositions in many plants, both monocots and dicots, in such species such as maize, rice, soybeans, wheat, oats, barley, and in non-plant systems, such as animals and fungi, that can be sexually propagated. Furthermore, an alternative strategy to microspore elimination is to eliminate female transmission of the transgene complex by engineering a megaspore suicide trait. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The semi-sterility trait is used to eliminate the products of meiosis (gametes) that carry a particular chromosomal region, such as a transposon launching site and/or transposase gene. This &ldquo;genetic sterility filter&rdquo; is used to eliminate male or female transmission of a transgene complex. This elimination process has the net effect of enriching for unlinked (dispersed) transposed elements or elements that recombined from the launching site; it is also used to simultaneously eliminate transmission of other genes, such as a transposase gene, thereby stabilizing transpositions in progeny. To achieve semi-sterility, a number of preferred methods are contemplated by the instant invention. One method relies on directing microspore-specific expression of a suicide gene to kill unwanted microspores. This method is achieved by employing a specific promoter, such as a pollen-specific promoter, fused to an appropriate suicide gene, thereby killing only the products of meiosis that have inherited the gene fusion. For a single copy transgene in hemizygous condition, this represents 50% of the gametes. Because pollen is produced in large excess, reducing pollen fertility by 50% has no major consequence on subsequent seed production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The aspect of the current invention relating to generating semi-sterility differs from previous methods aimed at achieving full male-sterility for hybrid seed production that are known in the art. In these methods, the aim has been to achieve complete male sterility to facilitate the commercial production of hybrid seed. This usually involves expression of the suicide gene in the sporophyte or in all microspores. For instance, bamase expression in tapetal cells results in complete male sterility (Beals, T. P. et al. (1997) The Plant Cell. Vol. 9:1527-45). In hybrid seed production, pollen semi-sterility would be insufficient to achieve the desired result, i.e. outcrossing of male-sterile (female) parent. In cases where a microspore-specific suicide gene and its associated elements are present in the genome in a single copy (in hemizygous condition), the suicide gene will be transmitted to approximately one-half of the products of meiosis, resulting in an average of 50% semi-sterility, a rate of viable pollen production that is commercially unacceptable for hybrid seed production. For the present invention, the production of 50% viable pollen is necessary and important to recover dispersed transpositions and/or to prevent transposase transmission. Hence, the gametophytic sterility trait is used as a filter to eliminate undesirable genomes while at the same time allowing other genomes (non-transgenic and genomes containing transposed elements without the donor element and/or transposase gene present) to be transmitted. In one embodiment, the present invention makes us of this &ldquo;genetic sterility filter&rdquo; to eliminate a transgene complex containing a transposon launching site and/or transposase source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> V. Breeding Methods </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Open-Pollinated Populations. The improvement of open-pollinated populations of such crops as rye, many maizes and sugar beets, herbage grasses, legumes such as alfalfa and clover, and tropical tree crops such as cacao, coconuts, oil palm and some rubber, depends essentially upon changing gene-frequencies towards fixation of favorable alleles while maintaining a high (but far from maximal) degree of heterozygosity. Uniformity in such populations is impossible and trueness-to-type in an open-pollinated variety is a statistical feature of the population as a whole, not a characteristic of individual plants. Thus, the heterogeneity of open-pollinated populations contrasts with the homogeneity (or virtually so) of inbred lines, clones and hybrids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Population improvement methods fall naturally into two groups, those based on purely phenotypic selection, normally called mass selection, and those based on selection with progeny testing. Interpopulation improvement utilizes the concept of open breeding populations; allowing genes for flow from one population to another. Plants in one population (cultivar, strain, ecotype, or any germplasm source) are crossed either naturally (e.g., by wind) or by hand or by bees (commonly <highlight><italic>Apis mellifera </italic></highlight>L. or <highlight><italic>Megachile rotundata </italic></highlight>F.) with plants from other populations. Selection is applied to improve one (or sometimes both) population(s) by isolating plants with desirable traits from both sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> There are basically two primary methods of open-pollinated population improvement. First, there is the situation in which a population is changed en masse by a chosen selection procedure. The outcome is an improved population that is indefinitely propagable by random-mating within itself in isolation. Second, the synthetic variety attains the same end result as population improvement but is not itself propagable as such; it has to be reconstructed from parental lines or clones. These plant breeding procedures for improving open-pollinated populations are well known to those skilled in the art and comprehensive reviews of breeding procedures routinely used for improving cross-pollinated plants are provided in numerous texts and articles, including: Allard, <highlight><italic>Principles of Plant Breeding, </italic></highlight>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1960); Simmonds, <highlight><italic>Principles of Crop Improvement, </italic></highlight>Longman Group Limited (1979); Hallauer and Miranda, <highlight><italic>Quantitative Genetics in Maize Breeding, </italic></highlight>Iowa State University Press (1981); and, Jensen, <highlight><italic>Plant Breeding Methodology, </italic></highlight>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1988). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Mass Selection. In mass selection, desirable individual plants are chosen, harvested, and the seed composited without progeny testing to produce the following generation. Since selection is based on the maternal parent only, and there is no control over pollination, mass selection amounts to a form of random mating with selection. As stated above, the purpose of mass selection is to increase the proportion of superior genotypes in the population. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Synthetics. A synthetic variety is produced by crossing inter se a number of genotypes selected for good combining ability in all possible hybrid combinations, with subsequent maintenance of the variety by open pollination. Whether parents are (more or less inbred) seed-propagated lines, as in some sugar beet and beans (Vicia) or clones, as in herbage grasses, clovers and alfalfa, makes no difference in principle. Parents are selected on general combining ability, sometimes by test crosses or topcrosses, more generally by polycrosses. Parental seed lines may be deliberately inbred (e.g. by selfing or sib crossing). However, even if the parents are not deliberately inbred, selection within lines during line maintenance will ensure that some inbreeding occurs. Clonal parents will, of course, remain unchanged and highly heterozygous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Whether a synthetic can go straight from the parental seed production plot to the farmer or must first undergo one or two cycles of multiplication depends on seed production and the scale of demand for seed. In practice, grasses and clovers are generally multiplied once or twice and are thus considerably removed from the original synthetic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> While mass selection is sometimes used, progeny testing is generally preferred for polycrosses, because of their operational simplicity and obvious relevance to the objective, namely exploitation of general combining ability in a synthetic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The number of parental lines or clones that enter a synthetic vary widely. In practice, numbers of parental lines range from 10 to several hundred, with 100-200 being the average. Broad based synthetics formed from 100 or more clones would be expected to be more stable during seed multiplication than narrow based synthetics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Hybrids. A hybrid is an individual plant resulting from a cross between parents of differing genotypes. Commercial hybrids are now used extensively in many crops, including corn (maize), sorghum, sugarbeet, sunflower and broccoli. Hybrids can be formed in a number of different ways, including by crossing two parents directly (single cross hybrids), by crossing a single cross hybrid with another parent (three-way or triple cross hybrids), or by crossing two different hybrids (four-way or double cross hybrids). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Strictly speaking, most individuals in an out breeding (i.e., open-pollinated) population are hybrids, but the term is usually reserved for cases in which the parents are individuals whose genomes are sufficiently distinct for them to be recognized as different species or subspecies. Hybrids may be fertile or sterile depending on qualitative and/or quantitative differences in the genomes of the two parents. Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, is usually associated with increased heterozygosity that results in increased vigor of growth, survival, and fertility of hybrids as compared with the parental lines that were used to form the hybrid. Maximum heterosis is usually achieved by crossing two genetically different, highly inbred lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The production of hybrids is a well-developed industry, involving the isolated production of both the parental lines and the hybrids which result from crossing those lines. For a detailed discussion of the hybrid production process, see, e.g., Wright, Commercial Hybrid Seed Production 8:161-176, In Hybridization of Corp Plants, supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> VI. Transposons and Transposable Elements </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Transposons are genetic elements capable of transposition (movement) from a donor chromosomal site to a target site on the same chromosome or different chromosome. Transposons cause mutations by insertion into coding sequences, introns, and promoters, often completely eliminating target gene activity. Mutations caused by transposons can often be destabilized by subsequent excision of the transposon from the gene. One or more proteins, collectively referred to as &ldquo;transposase&rdquo;, are required for the excision and integration of the transposon. Transposons that encode their own source of transposase are referred to as autonomous elements. Supplying transposase in trans can transpose transposons that do not encode transposase but contain terminal sequences, usually inverted repeats, required for transposition (non-autonomous elements). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> In one of the preferred embodiments, a Ds element is contemplated such that it contains the terminal sequences required for transposition (Coupland, G., et al., (1989) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86:9385-8; Chatterjee, S. et al., (1995) Mol Gen Genet. 249:281-8), a minimal promoter (-47 CaMV 35S promoter) fused to GUS reporter gene for enhancer detection; in opposite orientation, a splice acceptor site fused to an enhanced fluorescent, dual-spectrum GFP gene (Haseloff, J., et al., (1997) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 94:2122-7; Haseloff, J., et al., (1999) Methods Mol Biol. 122:241-59; Haseloff, J.

This Ds element can be used to screen for enhancer traps in one insertion orientation or gene traps in the other orientation, with respect to target gene transcription. A second embodiment using Ds substitutes a transcriptional activator at one end of the Ds element in order to generate gain-of-function mutations. Both elements contain a lox P site for site-specific recombination (Osborne, B.I., et al., (1995) 7:687-701; Medberry, S.

<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> B. Utility of Transposon and Insertion Mutations in Plants </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Transposons have great utility in genetic analysis and functional genomic analysis of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal genomes. In plants, genetically engineered transposons have been successfully introduced into several species (for review see Sundaresan, V, (1996) Trends Plant Sci. Vol. 1:184-190) including rice (Izawa, T. et al., (1997) Plant Mol Biol Vol. 35/1-2:219-29), tobacco, Arabidopsis, lettuce and several others. Several investigators have come up with ingenious methods to enhance the efficiency of recovering transposition events, including methods for positive selections for transposition (Fedoroff, N. V. et al., (1993) Plant J. Vol.:3:273-289; Honma, M. A. et al., (1993) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA Vol. 90/13:6242-6), selection for unlinked elements, (Tissier et al., (1999) The Plant Cell Vol. 11:1841-1852; W. R.; Sundaresan, et al., (1995) Genes Dev. 9/14:1797-810), dispersed launching sites throughout a genome (Cooley, M. B. et al., (1996) Mol Gen Genet Vol. 252/1-2:184-94, Knapp, S. et al., (1994) Mol Gen Genet Vol. 243/6:666-73; Osborne, B. I. et al., (1991) Genetics Vol. 129/3:833-44; Takken, F. L. et al., (1998) Plant J Vol. 14/4:401-11, Thomas, C. M, et al., (1994) Mol Gen Genet Vol. 242/5:573-85; van der Biezen, E. A. et al., 1996 Mol Gen Genet Vol. 251/3:267-80) and adding features into elements such as enhancer and gene traps (for reviews see Sharknes, W. C., (1990) Biotechnology 8:827-831; W. R.; Sundaresan, et al., (1995) Genes Dev 9/14:1797-810) and transcriptional activation (Fritze, K. et al. (1995) Methods Mol Biol Vol. 44:281-94; Kakimoto, T., (1996) Science Vol. 274/5289:982-5; Kardailsky, I.; et al, (1999) Science Vol. 286/5446:1962-5). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Even given the enormous progress in the utility of transposons, they still have limitations for functional genomic analysis. Transpositions are often intrachromosomal, often within a short physical distance between donor and target sites (Moreno, M. A et al., (1992) Genetics Vol. 131:939-956; Athma, P. et al., (1992) Genetics Vol. 131:199-209). This limitation means that most new insertions occur in regions surrounding the donor site (launching site) with many fewer elements found dispersed randomly throughout the genome. Secondly, the process of transposition is not usually controlled leading to a great many somatic insertions, which are not transmitted to progeny, and developmentally early transpositions that can lead to non-concordance in germinally transmitted events. The inability to control transpositions somatically and temporally can result in a high background of false positive insertions in genes of interest due to the non-correspondence between somatic and germinal mutational events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> C. Current State-of-the-Art Methods to Recover Dispersed Transpositions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Two methods are currently available to partially overcome the limitation of non-dispersed transpositions. One method makes use of first dispersing transposon launching sites throughout a genome. This method, however, requires a large number of transgenic starter lines to achieve widespread genome coverage. A second method to disperse transposition events is to employ a negative selectable marker(s), such as iaaH, pehA, R404, or a cytosine deaminase gene, to select against the donor site containing the transposon and/or transposase. Selection against the donor element also selects against nearby (linked) transpositions resulting in enrichment for unlinked transpositions. Negative selections have been used in Arabidopsis to recover unlinked Ds and Spm transpositions (W. R.; Sundaresan, et al., (1995) Genes Dev. 9/14:1797-810; Tissier, A. F., et al., (1999) The Plant Cell Vol. 11:1841-1852) and two negative selectable markers are based on proherbicide conversion (O&apos;keefe, D. P. et al., (1994) Plant Physiol Vol. 105:473-482; Dotson, S. B. et al., (1996) The Plant Journal Vol. 10/2:383-392), a process theoretically amenable to soil selections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, the use of negative selectable markers imposes serious limitations on the recovery of large numbers of independent transpositions. First, several of these markers require the use of tissue-culture based (W. R.; Sundaresan, et al., (1995) Genes Dev. 9/14:1797-810; transposition (Fedoroff, N. V. et al., (1993) Plant J. Vol.:3:273-289), a labor-intensive procedure that adds great expense and time to the process of recovering large numbers of dispersed transpositions. Second, negative selections are based on the elimination of progeny carrying linked elements or transposase, or both, by chemical (Tissier, A. F., et al., (1999) The Plant Cell Vol. 11:1841-1852; W. R.; Sundaresan, et al., (1995) Genes Dev. 9/14:1797-810). Progeny elimination can be problematic when seed number is limited. For instance, in a plant such as rice (<highlight><italic>Orza sativa</italic></highlight>), a predominantly self-pollinating species, outcrossing is tedious and time-consuming, greatly limiting the number of progeny that can be readily obtained. Hence, if transposition rates are low and unlinked transpositions represent the minority of transposition events, it would be costly and impractical to use negative selections to recover dispersed transpositions. For instance, accounting for a rate of 1-5% transposition, 50% meiotic segregation, and only 30% unlinked transpositions, to recover 10,000 transpositions by outcrossing would require an estimated several million progeny plants. Finally, the use of negative selectable agents, such as proherbicides, can have a serious environmental impact and be costly due to the applications of chemicals that may be needed to select for large numbers of progeny carrying dispersed transpositions. Moreover, most of these chemicals are not approved for field use. </paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Florally Expressed Transposase </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> A further limitation associated with using transposons for mutagenesis, gene-tagging and functional genomic analysis, is the lack of developmental and temporal control over the transposition process. In most cases transposase gene expression, under the control of its own promoter, or under the control of constitutive promoters, occurs during vegetative development of the plant. Vegetative expression of a transposase source leads to somatic transpositions. These transpositions are transmitted to progeny (germinal transpositions) only when these somatic cell lineages later produce megaspores or microspores. This is problematic for two reasons. One reason is that transpositions that occur during vegetative or early reproductive development can be clonally propagated and later transmitted into many gametes, resulting in a large number of non-independent elements recovered in progeny. This is undesirable when large numbers of independent transpositions are needed for functional genomic analysis or gene-tagging. Second, somatic transpositions often do not include lineages that give rise to gametes, such as those occurring in epidermal lineages or in terminal vegetative structures. These transpositions are never meiotically transmitted and therefore go unrecovered in progeny. This is problematic because these somatic events can be falsely identified in tissue DNA samples as mutations, yet are never recovered in progeny. This is especially problematic when mutational screens are PCR-based examples chemical (Tissier, A. F., et al., (1999) The Plant Cell Vol. 11:1841-1852; McKinney, E. C., et al., (1995) Plant J. Vol. 8:613-622; Krysan, P. J et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 93:8145-8150; Frey, M et al., (1997) Science Vol. 277:696-699). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the instant invention, to minimize the problem of somatic transpositions, a transposase gene is placed under the control of a floral-specific promoter that drives gene expression in subepidermal lineages of the flower that lead to the production of microspores and megaspores. Such promoters include those found in genes such as agamous, apetalal apetala2, apetala3, pistillate, and their homologs found in other plant species such as maize, and rice. For example, the apetala3 promoter drives expression of a reporter gene in petal and sepal primordial cells of the developing floral meristems. Transposase expression under the control of the ap3 promoter results in transpositions that are confined to floral development and, when occurring in lineages that give rise to microspores, these events will be transmitted to the next generation. Control of transposition by this method has two effects: 1) it shuts down somatic transpositions; and 2) it leads to a large number of independent transpositions when pollen is derived from many different floral meristems. Hence, somatic tissue can be sampled without the concern of somatic or secondary transpositions, and each floral meristem becomes an independent source of transposition events. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Approximately half of the world&apos;s population derives its caloric intake mainly from rice.

<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> At present, the U.S. produces 7.5 million metric tons of rice per year, planted on 1.4 million hectares, resulting in $1.7 billion dollars in commerce (Anonymous (2000) USDA World Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimates.

<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> Approximately 99% of the rice varieties currently grown are the result of public breeding programs, many originating from breeding programs sponsored by CGIAR international research centers (http://www.cgiar.org/irri/crucial.htm) such as International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). The majority of U.S. rice varieties are developed in the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and California.

<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Cereals include the most important food crops in the world, and are considered a relatively recent taxon, evolving from a common ancestor only 65 million years ago (Martin, W., et al., (1989) Nature 339:46-48; Moore, G., et al., (1995) Trends Genet. 11:81-82). This young history is reflected in a remarkable degree of conservation in gene structure and order even though differences have arisen in genome size, haploid chromosome number, and variations in repetitive sequence composition (Moore, G., et al., (1993) Bio/technology. 11:584-589). For example, the maize genome is 8-fold larger than that of rice (Ahn, S. et al., (1993) Genetics 90:7980-7984) and organized into a different number of chromosomes, yet comparative molecular analysis has shown that extensive synteny can be identified between much of their genomes (Ahn, S. et al., (1993) Genetics. 90:7980-7984; Bennetzen, J. L. et al., (1993) Trends Genet. 9:259-261). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Rice is an outstanding model plant for the cereal grasses. Rice can be used to investigate basic biological issues and to learn about agronomic traits such as yield, hybrid vigor, and single and multigenic disease resistance. Different races of rice are adapted to a wide variety of environmental situations, from tropical flooding to temperate dry land, so it is a model for real life adaptive responses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Rice has a relatively short generation time (90-120 days), making it possible to obtain three or more generations per year. A large collection of mutations have been discovered and characterized in rice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Transgenic rice is efficiently generated by either Agrobacterium-mediated (Hiei, Y., et al., (1994) Plant J. 6:271-82; Hiei, Y., et al, (1997) Plant Molec Bio. 35:205-218; Zhang, J., et al., (1997) Mol Biotechnol. 8:223-31) or biolistic methods (Christou, P., et al., (1991) Biotechnology. 9:957-962; Buchholz, W. G., et al., (1998) Methods Mol Biol. 81:383-96). Most importantly, rice has a genome size approximately 500 megabases (Mb) (Arumanagathan, K. et al., (1991) Plant Mol. Biol. Report. 9:208-218), only about 3-fold larger than that of the Arabidopsis genome, and scheduled to be sequenced around 2004. As a member of the Graminae and an important crop plant, a wealth of fundamental information about important aspects of plant biology can be learned from the rice genomics (McCouch, S. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:1983-5; Wilson, W. A., et al., (1999) Genetics. 153:453-73). </paragraph>

The two best-developed recombinational maps are those developed at Cornell (http://genome.cornell.edu/rice/) and at the Rice Genome Project (RGP) in Japan (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp), on which more than 3,000 RFLP and SSR markers have been mapped. The YAC-based physical map of rice covers more than 64% of the genome and contains 4,000 mapped ESTs (Ashikawa, I., et al., (1999) Genome. 42:330-7). A PAC library of 71,000 clones has been mapped with STSs and ESTs and the mapped clones cover approximately 30% of the genome. Two BAC libraries with 37,000 and 55,000 members have been BAC-end sequenced and finger printed and a BAC-based physical map has been constructed (http://www.genome.clemson.edu/ projects/rice/). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> D. Utility of a Transposon-Based Genomics Program </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> The main justification for the use of transposons is their distinct advantage over other types of mutagens for functional genomic studies. In rice, T-DNA and retrotransposon mutagenesis have serious limitations. Currently, both methods require continual tissue culture selection and somatic regeneration to recover insertions, processes that are inefficient, time-consuming and prone to induction of somaclonal variation (Bao, P. H., et al. (1996) Transgenic Res. 5:97-103; Evans, D. A. (1989) Trends Genet. 5:46-50). Both agents generate only stable insertions, which subsequently limit the utility of any mutant allele. To further complicate matters, T-DNA insertions are often large, complex tandem arrays, causing difficulties with molecular analysis of mutant alleles (McKinney, E. C., et al., (1995) Plant J. 8:613-622; Krysan, P. J., et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8145-8150; Krysan, P. J., et al., (1999) Plant Cell. 11:2283-2290; Galbiati, et al., (2000) Functional &amp; Integrative Genomics, in press). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> In many instances, single loss-of-function mutations, such as T-DNA- or retrotransposon-induced alleles, will not provide sufficient information to derive gene function. For instance, based on limited studies to date, many gene disruptions do not produce a readily discernable phenotype (McKinney, E. C., et al., (1995) Plant J. 8:613-622; Krysan, P. J., et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8145-8150). This does not imply lack of gene importance, however, since many of these genes will have partially redundant, overlapping or specific functions not detectable based on morphological or developmental screening of mutant lines. More detailed information, such as expression analysis and additional alleles, will be necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, two-element transposon mutagenesis, such as the Ac/Ds system, can generate stable gene disruptions by simple insertion. Genetically engineered Ds elements have been successfully introduced into several plant species (for review see Martienssen, R. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:2021-6; Sundaresan, V. (1996) Trends Plant Sci. 1:184-190) including rice (Izawa, T., et al. (1997) Plant Mol Biol. 35:219-29). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> The utility of transposons for functional genomics has been greatly enhanced by building features into synthetic transposons such as enhancer and gene traps (for reviews see Martienssen, R. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:2021-6; Sharknes, W. C. (1990) Biotechnology 8:827-831; Sundaresan, V., Springer, et al., (1995) Genes Dev. 9:1797-810) and transcriptional activation (Fritze, K. et al., (1995) Methods Mol Biol. 44:281-94; Kakimoto, T. (1996) Science. 274:982-5; Kardailsky, I., et al., (1999) Science. 286:1962-5). By incorporating such features, even genes that are genetically redundant can be functionally analyzed. Most importantly, the ability to remobilize a transposon creates the unique opportunity to efficiently generate derivative alleles and to efficiently mutate nearby genes by localized transposition properties of these elements (Long, D., et al., (1997) Plant J. 11:145-8; Jones, J. D. G., et al., (1990) Plant Cell. 2:701-707; Osborne, B. I., et al., (1991) Genetics. 129:833-44). Starting with a just a few, well-characterized transgenic lines and the appropriate genetic strategies, an extensive collection of dispersed transpositions can be efficiently generated without the need for subsequent tissue culture selection or regeneration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> E. Randomly Dispersing Ds Throughout the Rice Genome </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes methods that may be applied to specific genomes, including but not limited to, the rice genome. Rice is an outstanding model plant for the cereal grasses. In applying the methods of the instant invention to the rice genome, one goal is to produce an extensive collection of stable Ds insertions that are distributed throughout the rice genome. To accomplish this task, several genetic strategies are contemplated, with the main goals of minimizing non-independent transpositions, dispersed Ds transpositions throughout the rice genome, and stabilized transposed elements in progeny. A specific strain contemplated for use in the methods of the instant invention is <highlight><italic>Oryza sativa </italic></highlight>ssp. <highlight><italic>japonica cv. </italic></highlight>Nipponbare, the strain being sequenced by the IRGSP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the instant invention, randomly dispersing Ds throughout the rice genome is contemplated. Because Ds tends to transpose locally often over short genetic distances, genetic strategies must be used to counter this bias. In the past, this has been accomplished using various methods that basically involve selecting against the Ds launching site in progeny (Sundaresan, V., et al., (1995) Genes Dev. 9:1797-810; Tissier, A. F. et al., (1999) The Plant Cell 11:1841-1852), orby initially dispersing many launching sites throughout a genome (Osborne, B. I., et al., (1991) Genetics. 129:833-44; Cooley, M. B., et al., (1996) Mol Gen Genet. 252:184-94; Knapp, S., et al., (1994) Mol Gen Genet. 243:666-73; Takken, F. L., et al., (1998) Plant J. 14:401-11; Thomas, C. M., et al., (1994) Mol Gen Genet. 242:573-85; van der Biezen, E. A., et al., (1996) Mol Gen Genet. 251:267-80). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Two strategies for dispersing Ds transpositions are contemplated. The first method is broadly directed to including a pollen-specific suicide trait gene on the Ds launching site to eliminate transmission of the launching site along with any linked transposed elements. The suicide trait is engineered by incorporating a pollen-specific promoter driving expression of an appropriate cell death gene. Since the launching site construct is single copy and hemizygous in stock plants, 50% of the products of meiosis inherit T-DNA and undergo genetic suicide; the remaining products produce viable pollen. Those transposed Ds that have recombined, either intra- or inter-chromosomally with the launching site, are pollen transmitted. These elements are readily detected in progeny by incorporating an herbicide marker (bar gene) into the Ds element. The herbicide marker serves a dual purpose-as an initial tissue-culture selectable marker for nice transformation, and later as a soil-based selection for progeny harboring unlinked Ds elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> The pollen suicide method has distinct advantages over previous strategies to select for unlinked transpositions. Its main advantage is that pollen is produced in vast excess and pollen semi-sterility is environmentally sound and will have little, if any, impact on seed production. In progeny, 50% of the testcross offspring (or 75% when selling) are culled by negative selection simply because they inherit the launching site (and/or transposase gene, as explained below). In rice, when outcrossing is required to recover transpositions, seed production can be a limiting factor. Moreover, chemicals, such as proherbicides used for negative selection (Tissier, A. F., et al., (1999) The Plant Cell. 11:1841-1852; Dotson, S. B., et al., (1996) The Plant Journal. 10:383-392) are neither commercially available nor federally approved for field use. Tissue culture based negative selections (Sundaresan, V., et al., (1995) Genes Dev. 9:1797-810; Kobayashi, T., et al., (1995) Jpn J. Genet. 70:409-22) are impractical in rice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the instant invention, the pollen-specific suicide trait is engineered using an appropriate promoter driving the expression of a suicide gene. Several suicide genes are available, including the barnase gene (Goldman, M. H., et al., (1994) EMBO J. 13:2976-84), related RNases (Fedorova, N. D., et al., (1994) Mol Biol (Mosk). 28:468-71), diphtheria toxin A chain gene (Tsugeki, R. et al., (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 96:12941-6; Nilsson, O., et al., (1998) Plant J. 15:799-804; Uk Kim, et al., (1998) Mol Cells. 8:310-7; Day, C. D., et al., (1995) Development 121:2887-95) and others (DeLong, A., et al., (1993) Cell. 74:757-768). Use of the barnase gene has been shown to be an effective way to generate microspore-autonomous cell death when fused to a pollen-specific promoter (Custers, J. B., et al., (1997) Plant Mol Biol. 35:689-99). In contrast to previous methods, the methods of the instant invention depend on generating semi-sterility, as opposed to complete male sterility, which may be achieved in one aspect of the present invention by engineering barnase expression specifically in microspores. Several promoters are available for this purpose, including both rice (Zou, J. T., et al., (1994) Amer. J. Botany. 81:552-561) and maize pollen-specific promoters (Hamilton, D. A., et al., (1992) Plant Mol Biol. 18:211-8), and pollen-specific promoters from several dicotyledonous species (Twell, D., et al., (1991) Genes Dev. 5:496-507; Kulikauskas, R. et al., (1997) Plant Mol Biol. 34:809-14; Custers, J. B., et al., (1997) Plant Mol Biol. 35:689-99; Albani, D., et al., (1991) Plant Mol Biol. 16:501-13; Kim, Y. et al., (1992) Transgenic Res. 1:188-94; Twell, D., et al.; (1990) Development. 109:705-13; van Tunen, A. J., et al., (1990) Plant Cell. 2:393-401). In a preferred embodiment, a heterologous pollen-specific promoter, such as the maize promoter (Hamilton, D. A., et al., (1992) Plant Mol Biol. 18:211-8), is contemplated to minimize the possibility of gene silencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Evaluation of the effectiveness of the pollen suicide mechanism in eliminating T-DNA (launching sites), may be achieved for example, by employing a construct containing the suicide gene and the bar gene transformed into an organism such as rice via Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA transformation (Hiei, Y., et al., (1994) Plant J. 6:271-82; Hiei, Y., et al., (1997) Plant Molec Bio. 35:205-218; Zhang, J., et al.; (1997) Mol Biotechnol. 8:223-31). Several single copy T-DNA lines (SCTLs) would then be identified by Southern analysis (Ausebel, F. M., et al., (1987) In: <highlight><italic>Current protocols in molecular biology, </italic></highlight>ed. Chanda, V. B. Boston: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.). To test for the efficiency of T-DNA elimination, a PCR experiment would then be performed on unselected outcross progeny for detecting transmission of the T-DNA. This analysis would be performed on DNA pools from unselected progeny (e.g. a minimum of 384 DNA pools, each pool containing 12 plants). Using this evaluation procedure, it is contemplated that other constructs may be tested, such as those that include a transposase source (explained below), the pollen suicide gene, and the Ds-bar element. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the instant invention is directed to enriching for independent transpositions while minimizing the recovery of non-independent ones. One way to accomplish this is by delaying transposition in development to prevent the early clonal propagation and meiotic transmission of non-independent events. Control over the developmental timing of transposition is achieved by using heterologous promoters driving the Ac transposase gene (Rommens, C. M., et al., (1992) Mol Gen Genet. 231:433-41; Balcells, L. et al., (1994) Plant Mol Biol. 24:789-98; Scofield, S. R., et al., (1992) Plant Cell. 4:573-82; Swinbume, J., et al., (1992) Plant Cell. 4:583-95; Grevelding, C., et al., (1992) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 89:6085-9). Several heterologous promoters are envisaged in the instant embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the strategy to enrich for independent transpositions is to limit transposase expression exclusively to floral development, preferably excluding pistil expression (for reasons explained below), to prevent vegetative transpositions. A floral-specific promoter may be used to drive transposase expression during the formation of stamen primordia and several are available that preclude pistil expression such as rice (Moon, Y. H., et al., (1999) Plant Mol Biol. 40:167-77; Kang, H. G., et al., (1998) Plant Mol Biol. 38:1021-9; Greco, R., et al., (1997) Mol Gen Genet. 253:615-23) or maize MADS-box gene promoters (Mena, M., et al., (1996) Science 274:1537-40; Mena, M., et al., (1995) Plant J. 8:845-54). To enhance the frequency of transposition, both full-length cDNA and a truncated version of Ac transposase may be used in rice. The truncated version (ORF103-807) has been shown to enhance the frequency of transposition in heterologous plant species (Houba-Herin, et al., (1990) Mol Gen Genet. 224:17-23; Li, M. G. et al., (1990) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 87:6044-8). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Limiting transposase expression to floral development means that each floret represents an independent source of transpositions. Statistically, the recovery of non-independent transposition is low&mdash;if pollen from each anther is considered a source of independent transpositions then the frequency of progeny seed derived from pollen from the same anther will be unlikely&mdash;at least six times more anthers (six per spikelet) will be produced than seed (one per spikelet). Embodiments of the instant invention include the use of 35S-driven transposase (full-length and truncated) and florally-expressed transposase constructs transformed into rice along with a simple Ds element inserted into the 5&prime; UTR of a bar gene. Single copy insert lines are then identified by Southern analysis and these plants are outcrossed to wild type, male-sterile IR36 females. Progeny seedlings are then subjected to two foliar applications of Finale&reg; (see below) to select progeny in which Ds has excised. Based on the mechanism of Ac/Ds transposition (Chen, J., et al., (1987) Genetics. 117:109-116; Chen, J., et al., (1992) Genetics 130:665-676; Greenblatt, I. M. et al., (1962) Genetics. 47:489-501) more than 50% of these progeny contain linked or unlinked transposed Ds elements. Finale&reg;-resistant progeny from each stock are analyzed by Southern analysis to determine the effectiveness of recovery of independent transpositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Once transposed, the Ds element needs to be stabilized, yet still have the ability to be remobilized. To stabilize transposed Ds elements, the appropriate transposase gene is included within the final T-DNA construct containing the Ds launching site. The pollen suicide process or bar antisense strategy eliminates the transposase source along with the T-DNA, thereby stabilizing any transposed Ds element in progeny. Reintroducing transposase in subsequent generations can easily destabilize the Ds element, permitting localized mutagenesis of neighboring genes (Long, D., et al., (1997) Plant J. 11:145-8; Ito, T., et al., (1999) Plant J. 17:433-44) or reconstitutional (saturation) mutagenesis (Moreno, M. A., et al., (1992) Genetics. 131:939-956; Athma, P., et al., (1992) Genetics. 131; Das, L. et al., (1995) Plant Cell. 7:287-94) of any single gene. cl EXAMPLES </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Preventing or Eliminating Transmission of a Transgene </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> When hemizygous, eliminating transmission of a transgene locus is achieved by linking a gene of interest to a suicide gene under the control of a male- or female-specific promoter. This construct, termed the &ldquo;gametophytic suicide trait&rdquo; (GST) induces cell death that is restricted to the microspores or megaspores which receive the GST, thereby effectively reducing or eliminating transmission of the gene of interest that is linked to the GST. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The gene carrying the special trait (i.e., transgene of interest) that you want to eliminate from transgenic pollen can be placed anywhere as long as it is in physical proximity to the GST. Because the GST transgene complex is hemizygous, there will be complete linkage in the GST transgene complex and there is no concern that the GST and other genes and/or transgenes will recombine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> The methods of this invention can be used with in planta or seed transformation techniques that do not require culture or regeneration. Examples of these techniques are described in Bechtold, N., et al. (1993) CR Acad. Sci. Paris/Life Sciences 316:1 118-93; Chang, S. S., et al. (1990) Abstracts of the Fourth International Conference on Arabidopsis Research, Vienna, p. 28; Feldmann, K. A. and Marks, D. M (1987) Mol. Gen. Genet. 208:1-9; Ledoux, L., et al. (1985) Arabidopsis Inf Serv. 22:1-11; Feldmann, K. A. (1992) In: Methods in Arabidopsis Research (Eds. Koncz, C., Chua, N -H, Schell, J.) pp. 274-289; Chee, et al., U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 5,376,543. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Arabidopsis. </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Plasmids containing the GST constructs (i.e., AtS9PSP:barnase:nos or OsPSP:barnase:Nos) linked to the bar transgene are transformed by electroporation into Agrobacterium and then into Arabidopsis using the vacuum infiltration method (Bechtold et al., 1993, supra). As discussed previously, the bar gene construct codes for phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (PAT) driven by the CaMV 35S promoter to provide resistance to phophinothricin (PPT). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> Transformants are selected based on resistance to PPT, and T2 seed is generated from a number of independent lines. This seed is plated on GM media containing various concentrations of herbicide and scored for germination and survival. Multiple transgenic lines overexpressing either the wild type or the resistant mutant produce significant numbers of green seedlings on an herbicide concentration that is lethal to the empty vector control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> The transgene or gene of interest to be included in the transgene complex and the initial transgenic lines need only be characterized for number of transgene loci and complexity of the transgene insertion in order to identify lines with single-copy, non-tandemly duplicated insertions. Characterization of the initial transgenics is accomplished by PCR and/or Southern analysis, both methods being well known to those skilled in the art of DNA amplification and gel electrophoresis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Transformed plants hemizygous for the GST/transgene of interest, in this example the bar gene, are grown under the same growing conditions with transformed plants homozygous/heterozygous for the transgene of interest alone (i.e., no GST is present with the transgene) and with control, wild-type plants (i.e., plants lacking both GST and the transgene of interest) using appropriate statistical procedures (e.g., randomized complete block design or lattice design). Pollen is collected from the each of the individual plants and analyzed for the transgene and/or controlled crosses to wild-type plants are conducted and the seed is collected on a per plant basis and the resultant seeds/plants are analyzed for the transgene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Plants hemizygous for the GST/transgene complex and wild-type plants produce pollen and/or seeds/plants all of which fail to contain the transgene of interest. In contrast, plants heterozygous for the transgene produce pollen and seeds/plants which show normal segregation for the transgene of interest. Plants homozygous for the transgene of interest produce pollen all of which contain the transgene of interest. Plants homozygous for the transgene of interest when crossed to wild-type plants produce F2 seeds/plants which show normal segregation patterns for the transgene of interest. Thus, plants hemizygous for the GST/transgene complex fail to produce pollen with the transgene while plants homozygous or heterozygous for the transgene alone produce at least some pollen which does contain the transgene of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> This is the same situation for the dispersed transposition aspect of the invention. The initial transgene complex carries both the GST and transposon and/or transposase. After the transgenic lines are generated, they are selected for dispersed transpositions. That is, one or two transgenic lines are all that are needed for subsequent selections. No further transformation is necessary. An additional, optional transgene, such as the CaMV 35S promoter/bar gene construct can be added if desired to aid in the selection of transformants. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Turfgrass </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> A nucleic acid construct (GST) in which the gene encoding barnase under the control of a pollen-specific promoter from maize is made such that the Roundup&reg; resistance gene is linked to the GST. A virgin (i.e., wild-type) turfgrass genome is transformed with the transgene complex containing the three elements (maize pollen-specific promoter, barnase gene, Roundup&reg; resistance gene) such that the resultant transgenic plant is hemizygous for the transgene complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> The transgenic plant is vegetatively propagated to yield progeny plants that are also hemizygous for the transgene complex. Although all plants generated asexually from the transgenic plants are resistant to Roundup&reg; treatment, transmission of the Roundup&reg; resistance gene via cross-pollination is eliminated because no viable transgenic pollen is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Since the GST construct is male-specific, the hemizygotic transgenic lines can be maintained by crossing to wild-type pollen. When transgene elimination is required (e.g., in selection for dispersed transpositions) then the hemizygotic transgenic lines are used as males (pollen donors) and crossed to wild-type females. In this instance, only non-transgenic pollen or pollen containing dispersed transpositions would be propagated. For the purposes of eliminating unwanted pollen transmission of a transgene (e.g., herbicide resistance in turfgrass), the hemizygotic transgenic lines can be planted and only wild-type pollen will survive. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Alfalfa </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> A nucleic acid construct (GST) in which the gene encoding barnase, under the control of a pollen-specific promoter from rice, is made such that a Bt gene is linked to the GST. A virgin (i.e., wild-type) alfalfa genome is transformed with the transgene complex containing the three elements (rice pollen-specific promoter, barnase gene, Bt gene) such that the resultant transgenic plant is hemizygous for the transgene complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> The hemizygotic transgenic plant is vegetatively propagated to yield progeny plants that are also hemizygous for the transgene complex. Although the plant is resistant/tolerant to certain lepidopteran insect pests, transmission of the Bt gene via cross pollination is eliminated because no viable transgenic pollen is produced. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Transformed Corn </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> In the case of corn, the GST/transgene complex is inserted into the corn genome and the &ldquo;female&rdquo; parent carries the transgene complex. Upon hybridization with wild-type pollen, only &frac12; of the progeny hybrid seed will carry the transgene complex (not a problem for functional genomics applications). This limitation is circumvented by using a flp or lox recombinase system&mdash;the GST trait is kept inactive and homozygous until the hybrid is produced. At that point, frt&mdash;or cre-mediated recombination activates the GST trait (e.g., by removing a DNA block to transcription or by activating transcription), now present in all hybrid progeny instead of &frac12;. The transgene complex containing activated GST is eliminated from any pollen inheriting the transgene complex (e.g. 50% of the meiotic products). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Enriching Dispersed Transposition Events </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> By physically linking the sterility trait to a transposon launching site and/or transposase source, the &ldquo;genetic sterility filter&rdquo; is used to highly enrich for dispersed and/or stabilized transposition events without the use of chemicals and without the need to select against progeny containing linked transposition events and/or transposase source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> For instance, when 50% pollen sterility is achieved, the remaining viable haploid genomes will not have inherited the suicide gene and its associated elements such as the transposon launching site and/or transposase gene because of normal homologous chromosome segregation, independent assortment and meiotic recombination. A fraction of these viable genomes will contain newly transposed elements, especially those elements that have assorted independently or recombined from the launching site and its associated suicide gene. Therefore, the &ldquo;genetic sterility filter&rdquo; eliminates gametes containing transposed elements that remain linked to the launching site and/or gametes containing a transposase gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> If the remaining viable pollen is used to fertilize ovules, either by controlled pollinations or by wind-pollination, a fraction of the resultant progeny will contain transposed elements. These progeny are readily identified by the inclusion of a selectable or screenable marker inside of the transposon, such as the petunia, Arabidopsis, or Agrobacterium CP4 EPSPS gene (Padgette, S. R. et al., (1987) Arch Biochem Biophys Vol. 258/2:564-73; Klee, H. J. et al., 1987 Mol Gen Genet Vol. 210/3:437-42; Hoef, A., et al., (1998) Food Addit Contam Vol.15/7:767-74; Harrison, L. A., et al, (1996) J Nutr Vol. 126/3:728-40), encoding glyphosate (Roundup&reg;) resistance (Malik, J., et al., (1989) Biofactors Vol. 2/1:17-25); or a variety of acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes, encoding resistance to sulfonylurea herbicides (Whitcomb, C. E. (1999) Toxicol Ind Health Vol. 15/1-2:231-9), such as the Arabidopsis multiherbicide-resistant gene, csr1-4 (Mourad, G. et al., (1994) Mol Gen Genet Vol.: 243/2:178-84), or the bar gene from Streptomyces (Thompson, C. J et al., (1986) EMBO J. Vol. 6:2519-2523), encoding resistance to phosphinothricin (Finale&reg;), to name a few. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> In the case of the transmission of an autonomous element, such as Ac, progeny containing dispersed transposed Ac elements are identified by classical genetic means such as transactivation of a Ds-induced reporter gene. In one embodiment of the instant invention, the transposon is constructed with a pollen survival gene that permits only viable pollen that contain transposed elements, thereby completely eliminating the need for chemical selection or screens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> If the GST complex additionally contains a transposable element, then the frequency of transposition (both to linked and unlinked sites) can be high, depending on the source of transposase and other factors. Assuming a transposition frequency of 5%, 70% of which may be linked, then 30% are unlinked and 15% of these (random independent assortment of the transposon with the GST chromosome) will be recovered in progeny and easily identified by herbicide resistance contained on the transposable element. If we want to recover 100,000 independent insertions, an estimate of the number of seed required would be: (100,000&times;2/0.3)/0.05&equals;13,333,333 F1 seed needed. These could be generated and screened (recovered as individual plants) in less than 3 years. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Enriching Stably Dispersed Transposition Events </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the instant invention is directed to inclusion, in the transgene complex, in addition to the transposon launching site and the suicide gene, other genes such as a transposase source. In this embodiment, the &ldquo;genetic sterility filter&rdquo; enriches for dispersed elements while also eliminating the transmission of the transposase source to progeny. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> The simultaneous elimination of the transposon donor site and transposase gene has the added benefit of transmitting transposed elements that are stabilized (i.e. no longer transposing due to loss of the transposase gene) thereby preventing additional transpositions (secondary transpositions) from occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the instant invention include positioning the transposase source and transposon launching sites in separate transgene complexes. For instance, the launching site and the transposase source can be brought together in one genome on separate elements to achieve the same enrichment for dispersed transpositions. Moreover, in cases where localized transposition is desirable, i.e., to saturate a specific chromosomal region with insertions or to recover insertions in nearby genes of interest, the transposase source is eliminated by the sterility filter method without necessarily eliminating linked transpositions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> A. Rice Transformation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> Rice transgenics are generated employing a 24-well microtiter-based method that permits high throughput transgenic production. The method is an adaptation of published protocols (Hiei, Y., et al., (1994) Plant J. 6:271-82; Hiei, Y. et al. (1997) Plant Molec Bio. 35:205-218; Zhang, J., et al., (1997) Mol Biotechnol. 8:223-31) and involves an entirely liquid culturing and transformation system that allows the production of transgenic from scutellar callus induction, co-cultivation with Agrobacterium, treatment with Timentin, and shoot regeneration. This system is used to generate ca. 50-100 independent transgenic lines each month. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> A tissue sample from each transgenic line is collected, DNA extracted and analyzed by Southern to identify lines that contain single copy T-DNA inserts (SCTLs). Shoots from SCTLs are micropropagated, rooted and transplanted to soil according to methods well known to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> B. Genetic Methodologies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> A broad-based, high volume-crossing program is available at CIAT for the generation of stocks, seed and transposon lines. Typically, about 1000 controlled (hand) crosses are made each cycle, including single, doubled, top and backcrosses. Number of F1 seeds obtained depends on the cross type and breeding objectives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> Crosses can be made throughout the year under biosafety-approved screenhouse conditions. Three plantings of parents at intervals of from 7 to 10 days are made to assure simultaneous flowering. Parents are grown in large pots or grown in the field in a hybridization block when employing the male-sterile female line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> For hand pollinations, the methods for crossing are: selection of parent plants, emasculation of panicles (removal of anthers for the female parent), covering of emasculated florets with a glassine bag, pollination of female parent with pollen collected from the male parent, covering of the pollinated panicle with the glassine bag, and identification of panicles used for crossing with a crossing tag containing relevant information about the parents, dates, and name of the person who did the crossing. For detailed information on the hybridization of rice see, for example, Coffman, W. R. and R. M. Herrera (1980) Rice, In: Hybridization of Crop Plants, W. R. Fehr and H. H. Hadley, Editors, Chapter 36: 511-522, American Society of Agronomists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Selected F1 and T1 plants are harvested individually to produce F2 seeds. About 25 days after pollination hybrid seed is harvested, threshed, cleaned, placed in coin envelopes. This seed is stored under low humidity and temperature. T1 seed are grown in flats and selected for herbicide resistance by two foliar applications of 0.05% Finale&reg; at 25 and 35 days after germination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> C. Sample Tracking </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> A relational, barcode sample tracking database can be used to track plants, seed, and DNA samples through the workflow. Each transgenic that is created is assigned a unique (alphanumeric) identifier. Stock plants derived from transgenics carry this identifier and a second unique stock identifier. All stocks that enter the production nurseries carry the transgenic/stock identifiers and testcross seed derived from each stock are assigned a unique identifier for each cross (T1 seed lot). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> After Finale&reg; selection, each resistant plant is assigned a unique line identifier. This information is coded on a plant label with two tearoff labels; each one contains identical alphanumerical identifiers and associated barcode. One tearoff label is attached to tissue sample and the other remains on the plant, ultimately stapled to the seed package. A widget bar code reader logs tissue samples into a database that then tracks samples through the DNA extraction queue and ultimately into a position of a 384-microtiter plate used for PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> D. High-Throughput DNA Isolation and Normalization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Tissue samples are lyophilized prior to DNA extraction. Lyophilized tissue for shipping in plastic bags is sealed with desiccant. Tissue is ground with zirconium silica beads (ATGC, Inc.) by rapidly shaking 96-384 tubes on a commercial 10 gal paint shaker (Fluid Dynamics, Inc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> The DNA is extracted using a high throughput, parallel method adapted from previously published methods (Galbiati, M., et al., (2000) Functional &amp; Integrative Genomics, in press) and the purified DNA is stored in 96-format microtiter plate. DNA concentration is measured robotically by the Picogreen method (Molecular Probes, Inc.) using a Spectrofluor plate reader and Genesis robotics workstation (Tecan, Inc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> To make a second working plate for PCR analysis, DNA is normalized robotically by removing a fixed amount of DNA from each well together with the appropriate amount of buffer into a second microtiter plate. Mother-daughter replicas of these normalized working plates are made robotically and samples are shipped for amplification and sequencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> The feasibility of this entire procedure, including scripts, from tissue extraction to normalization, has been enabled for both maize and Arabidopsis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> E. Selection of Transposon Lines </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> Selection of transposon lines involves transgenic production and genetic testing for the recovery of single copy lines (SCLs), scaleup, sample tracking, processing and shipping followed by a production phase. Methods including DNA fingerprinting of T-DNA both in Agrobacterium inoculants and in primary rice transgenics, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocols, and methods for rice regeneration, micropropagation, and transplantation to soil may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Tissue is collected from each transgenic line, DNA extracted and analyzed by Southern analysis to identify single copy T-DNA lines (SCLs). All SCLs may be maintained in shoot culture and shipped for micropropagation. Rooted plantlets may be transplanted to soil and tested for transposition rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> F. Stock Production </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Genetic data on transposition frequencies is used to select for the best transgenic lines for continual stock production. Rooted shoots are transplanted to soil and firther propagated by simple division to increase the numbers of male plants in the production nursery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, if transpositions are limited to stamen development, an alternative, but not mutually exclusive method of stock propagation, is to cross wild-type pollen to the female transgenic plants - T-DNA elimination and transposition will not occur in this direction. Therefore, this seed can simply be replanted each season to generate additional stock for new transposition selections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> The flowering time for the rice variety Nipponbare is 60 days when grown at or near the equator. By using an equatorial location it is possible to achieve nearly 4 plant generations each year. The abbreviated generation time and constant year-round growing conditions in Cali, Mexico make rice genetics nearly as efficient as Arabidopsis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> G. Foundation Seed Production </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the instant invention, the objective is to select for single, dispersed transpositions and to recover these insertions in hemizygous condition. This permits the recovery of non-lethal, recessive lethal and female haplo-insufficient mutations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> To produce T1 seed, stock plants are crossed as males to male-sterile female plants in the nursery. Efficient outcrossing in rice can be achieved by interplanting males and male-sterile females. Male-sterility in Nipponbare is not presently available so a nuclear male sterility (ms) mutation is introgressed from an <highlight><italic>O. sativa </italic></highlight>ssp. <highlight><italic>indica </italic></highlight>strain into Nipponbare in the nurseries. The introgression process is greatly accelerated by marker-assisted mapping and breeding, selecting backcross progeny for the ms mutation and Nipponbare markers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> The ms locus is first mapped using previously characterized simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (McCouch, S. R., et al., (1997) Plant Mol Biol. 35:89-99; Panaud, O., et al., (1996) Mol Gen Genet. 252:597-607). 7000 SSR sequences are available from the Monsanto rough draft (www.rice-research.org). Linked SSRs are used to follow the ms allele during introgression, while unlinked SSRs throughout the genome are used to select against donor germplasm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Two backcrosses and one self pollination should be sufficient to transfer the ms allele to the Nipponbare background. The F1 crosses are made and F2 progeny are generated. The introgressed ms line is made available for T1 seed production. A 1:1 line segregating for the ms phenotype is used in the nursery, genotyped by SSR analysis, and the male-fertile plants culled. Transposon stocks are hybridized to ms/ms female plants to generate T1 seed for Ds line selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> H. Transposon Line Selection </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> T1 seed is planted in flats and 25-day-old seedlings are selected by a foliar application of 0.05% Finale&reg; followed by a second treatment 10-15 days later. Finale&reg;-resistant plants are bar-coded and transplanted to the nursery and allowed to self-pollinate to generate T2 seed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> A tissue sample (ca. 1-2 gm leaf tissue) from each plant is collected, placed in bar-coded tubes, lyophilized and prepared for DNA extraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> T2 seed from each line are collected, threshed, placed in bar-coded envelopes and prepared for storage or public distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been disclosed with reference to specific embodiments, it is apparent that other embodiments and variations of this invention may be devised by others skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. The appended claims are intended to be construed to include all such embodiments and equivalent variations. </paragraph>
