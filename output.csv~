<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an improvement for a protective helmet and more particularly for a helmet having at least two front protective shields that are moveable in rotation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background and Material Information </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Protective helmets have long been commonly used in different fields, whether professional, as is the case for military personnel, airplane or helicopter pilots, police officers or firemen, or civil or private use, as is the case for motorcycle users, rally or race car drivers, or construction workers. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There is no lack of applications and numerous helmets are already known which have a rigid outer shell having a substantially spherical shape, equipped with an inner lining, and adapted to nest around the user&apos;s cranium while providing a facial opening for his face at the front. These helmets generally have an inner envelope of synthetic foam adapted to absorb shocks. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Certain helmets also have facial shields adapted to promote the protection of the user&apos;s face while allowing him to observe external events. Thus, helmets provided with an external visor and an internal ocular shield are found in prior art. However, these helmets have numerous disadvantages that are linked to their manufacture, use or cost. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Indeed, it is usually difficult to obtain journals of facial shields on the outer shell and the prior art devices do not satisfy entirely given their frailty, complexity and lack of comfort during use. In addition, since protective helmets are developed to adapt to different types of users, any increase in the number of sizes necessarily implies obtaining an equal number of sizes for most of the accessories and attachments, especially for different facial shields, thus increasing the development cost of these helmets. </paragraph>

</section>

<section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, the object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned disadvantages by means that are simple, reliable, easy to implement and affordable. It has the objective of presenting a protective helmet having several facial shields, the journal configuration of the shields being simplified to allow easy manipulation thereof. This configuration also allows developing several different sizes of helmets while continuing to use a single shield size, for example. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to its main feature, the protective helmet of the invention is of the type constituted by an outer shell adapted to protect the user&apos;s head and having at least two protective shields rotationally mobile with respect to the shell, and it is characterized in that a first shield is rotationally journalled on the shell, whereas a second shield is rotationally journalled on an intermediary connecting element attached to the shell. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to an additional feature of the protective helmet, it is characterized in that the first shield is journalled about a pivot axis that is integral with the shell, and the second shield is journalled about a pivot axis that is integral with the connecting element, and in that these two pivot axes are co-axial and are borne by the same transverse axis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the protective helmet of the invention, the main transverse axis bearing the journal axes is arranged in a zone located substantially at the upper end of the user&apos;s ear. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative embodiment of the protective helmet of the invention, the rotational axes of the protective shields are not arranged in a co-axial manner. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the protective helmet, it is characterized in that the first shield journalled on the shell is a large sized facial shield adapted to at least partially occupy, when it is in a position of use, a facial opening presented by the helmet, and in that the second shield journalled on the connecting element is an ocular shield adapted to be positioned into a position of use in front of the user&apos;s eyes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to an additional feature of the protective helmet of the invention, the connecting element is constituted of two lateral walls connected together by a portion of a spherical cap and is attached to the helmet shell so as to be immoveable with respect thereto. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the protective helmet, the latter is characterized in that the first shield is a facial shield assembled onto a shield support which extends it and which is journalled on the shell about a pivot axis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the protective helmet of the invention, the shield support has two lateral walls, both of them having an attaching member for the facial shield and a pivot opening adapted to cooperate with the journal axis attached to the shell. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to an additional feature of the protective helmet of the invention, the shield support has a pivot opening adapted to cooperate with a journal axis attached to the shell, and in that the opening and the axis have complementary indexing means adapted to index at least the two extreme positions of the facial shield. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the protective helmet, the latter is characterized in that it has a rigid shock absorbing cap that is maintained in position in the upper portion of the shell, due at least partially to the connecting element.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) is of a rigid material and can be made of any appropriate material, such as plastic, steel, aluminum, or of a composite material of the type including a layering of reinforcement fibers that are impregnated and connected together by a resin matrix. According to the overall structure of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the outer shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), is constituted by a substantially spherical wall having several wall portions, namely, an upper front wall portion (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) extended rearwardly by an upper rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) which is itself extended downwardly by a lower rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and, in addition, it has two lateral wall portions: a right lateral wall portion (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and a left lateral wall portion (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The upper front portion (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) corresponds to the zone occupied by the user&apos;s forehead and is limited by the upper edge (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) of the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) which in turn is limited laterally by two lateral edges (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). The upper rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) corresponds to the zone occupied by the user&apos;s cranium, whereas the lower rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) corresponds to the zone occupied by the user&apos;s nape. Added to this is the fact that the wall of the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) is limited toward the bottom by a lower edge (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). The lateral wall portions (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) correspond to the zones occupied by the user&apos;s ears and are limited towards the front by the corresponding lateral edge (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) of the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and toward the bottom by the front ends of the lower edge (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) has at least two protective shields (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), both shields being rotationally mobile with respect to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) between two positions, namely, between an active lowered position of use (B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and an inactive raised position of non-use (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is journalled directly on the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), whereas the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is journalled on a connecting element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) integral with the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the invention, the helmet has a large sized facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) adapted to occupy the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) when it is in a position of use (B <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It also includes a smaller sized shield, called an ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), adapted to be positioned more specifically in front of the user&apos;s eyes when it is in a position of use (B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is constituted by a transparent wall made, for example, from plastic of the polycarbonate type or the like. This wall is essentially a spherical portion that is limited in order to be comprised between the two converging transverse planes (P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) forming a dihedral with an angle A open towards the front. The facial shield is constituted by a front wall (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) formed by a substantially spherical portion having a radius (R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) extended laterally towards the rear by two lateral arms (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) or ocular shield shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is constituted by a transparent wall made, for example, from plastic of the polycarbonate type or the like. This wall is essentially a spherical portion that is limited in order to be comprised between the two converging transverse planes (P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) forming a dihedral with an angle B open towards the front. The ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is constituted by a front wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) formed by a substantially spherical portion with a radius (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) extended laterally towards the rear by two lateral arms (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Added to this is the fact that the angle A formed by the two planes (P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is greater than the angle B formed by the two planes (P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), and that the radius (R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the spherical wall of the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is greater than the radius (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the spherical wall of the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) or ocular shield is of a smaller size than the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) or facial shield. Thus, the front wall (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) has a height (H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) measured in the generally symmetrical plane (P), which is greater than the height (H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the front wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) measured under the same conditions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) or facial shield is journalled directly about a rotational axis (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) integral with the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), whereas the ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is journalled about a rotational axis (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) integral with an intermediary connecting element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) attached to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the invention, the journal axes (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) of the two shields are advantageously arranged in each other&apos;s extension, i.e., they are borne by the same generally pivoting transverse axis (XX&prime;) that is substantially orthogonal to the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the helmet. It goes without saying that the two axes could be positioned in two separate locations so as to no longer be co-axial without leaving the scope of protection of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The intermediary element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is formed of two lateral walls (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) connected together by a portion of a spherical cap (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). It is advantageously attached to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) at the lower end of its lateral walls so as to be immoveable with respect to the shell. The attachment of the connecting piece (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is done at two separate points of each of the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) near the lower edge (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) of the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) by means of two screws (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) adapted to cooperate with complementary housings (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>) located on the inner surface of the shell, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the invention, the journal of the ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and of the facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is obtained co-axially in a zone located substantially at the level of the upper end of the user&apos;s ear. It is noted that in order to use the same type of facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) for the different shell sizes (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) itself is affixedly assembled to a shield support (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) which allows extending the facial shield and which is journalled on the pivot axis (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) arranged on the inner surface of the shell. Thus, to develop several helmet sizes, a facial shield of one size is used and is adapted to be installed on any helmet by means of a shield support (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) which allows adapting the shield to all sizes of shells (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) by lengthening the journal arms. This support element (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) is in the shape of an arc (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) that extends between two lateral wall portions (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), which each have an attaching member for the facial shield, such as affixing tabs arranged in a circular manner and projecting in toward the helmet to cooperate with an opening (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) located at the end of the facial shield itself, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. These wall portions (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the support (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) also have, at their lower end, a journal opening (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) adapted to cooperate with the journal axis (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is noted that the shape of the opening (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) is not round but polygonal, thus allowing it to cooperate with complementary indexing means described hereinafter, which allow indexing the specific positions of the facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), such as the active position (B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the raised position (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet, the indexing means and the journal axis are obtained from the same element (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) that is attached to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) by means of a known screw system (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) and housing for attachments (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). This journal and indexing element (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) includes an assembly of ramps and projections adapted to index at least two extreme positions (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) due, in particular, to the elastic deformation of the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) that are distanced one from the other when their opening (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) and the ramps cooperate to allow pivoting between the two extreme indexed positions (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the latter has a rigid shock absorbing cap (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) made of polyurethane foam, for example, and adapted to occupy the upper portion of the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). This car. (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) is advantageously maintained in position in the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) due to the intermediary connecting element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the helmet that is not shown, the journal axes of the two shields are no longer co-axial but occupy a separate position, the journal axis of the facial shield being arranged on the shell and that of the ocular shield being arranged on the intermediary connecting element in different positions. The facial shield is mounted on its support and thus allows extending the shield up to its journal axis, whereas the ocular shield is journalled about a journal axis of a traditional type which has no specific indexing means, but whose shield position can be blocked due to the friction between the axis and the shield while pivoting. It is noted that the ocular shield can also be provided with indexing means that are similar or dissimilar to those of the outer facial shield. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is also noted that the ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) has a maneuvering handle (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) arranged on the lower edge of the ocular shield near the journal axis (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) which bears it and the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) so as to allow the user to activate it. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to correctly define the pivoting positions and to protect the indexing means which can be arranged on the two shields (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), it is noted that an abutment system which limits the pivoting of one or both shields downwardly and/or upwardly could also be provided. Added to this is the fact that the pivoting of one or both shields could be free or stopped, such as, for example, by friction at the level of its journal (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) or elsewhere in an appropriate zone. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> From the drawings, it is noted that the ocular shield and more specifically its front wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) has, during pivoting, a very short trajectory such that this shield is very close to the user&apos;s face, and especially to the eyes, just like ordinary glasses. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In fact, a central cutout (<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>), open downwardly, is advantageously provided, and is adapted for the passage of the user&apos;s nose. Furthermore, a comfort and finishing joint can be provided on the lower edge of the shield. The facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) has, during its pivoting, a trajectory that is naturally farther apart which allows the shield to move forwardly beyond the zone occupied by the user&apos;s nose. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the user could individually place either of the two in a lowered or raised position, or both shields at the same time, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, in particular. It is noted that the helmet advantageously has an inner cap (not shown) adapted for the user&apos;s comfort and correct positioning of the helmet. In the rear part of the helmet, this cap is advantageously attached directly to the attaching members arranged on the inner surface of the shell, whereas in the front part of the helmet, it is attached to the intermediary connecting element which bears the ocular shield and its journal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Of course, the invention is not limited to the embodiments described and represented by way of examples, and it also includes any technical equivalents as well as combinations thereof. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The instant application is based upon the French priority Patent Application No. 00 06822, filed May 29, 2000, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference thereto, and the priority of which is hereby claimed under 35 U.S.C. &sect;119. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional face guards or masks for protective helmets, such as football helmets, are typically manufactured using steel wire or steel tubing. Steel-based face guards desire improvement as they are relatively heavy and prone to corrosion. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention advantageously relates to a face guard made of titanium wire having advantageous weight and corrosion-resistance characteristics as compared to steel-based face guards. The invention further relates to a method for producing face guards made of titanium wire in an manner that is uncomplicated and cost effective. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved face guard for protective helmets. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a face guard of the character described for use with football helmets. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that weighs less than conventional steel-based face guards. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that is less prone to corrosion as compared to conventional steel-based face guards. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that is made using titanium wire. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that is economical. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a method for producing face guards of the character described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> With regard to the foregoing and other objects, the present invention is directed to a method of making a face mask including the steps of providing a plurality of lengths of Grade 2, commercially pure titanium wire, having a diameter of from about 0.21 to about 0.24 inches; forming each length at room temperature using rotary bending apparatus to a desired bend angle by bending the member at room temperature to a first bend angle that is from about 1.25 to about 1.35 times greater than the desired bend angle; and welding each of the thus formed lengths to at least one other of the lengths in an ambient, oxygen containing environment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention relates to a face mask including a plurality of wire members interconnected to one another. Each wire member includes a length of Grade 2, commercially pure titanium wire, having a diameter of from about 0.21 to about 0.24 inches. Each wire member is formed at room temperature using rotary bending apparatus to a desired bend angle by bending the member at room temperature to a first bend angle that is from about 1.25 to about 1.35 times greater than the desired bend angle. Each of the formed members is welded to at least one other of the members in an ambient, oxygen containing environment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the foregoing lengths are for a preferred embodiment only and that the wires may be of various other lengths depending on the desired configuration and size of the mask. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The members are next formed, preferably at room temperature (e.g., about 50 to about 80&deg; F.), to impart a desired shape to each of the wires <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the desired configuration preferably being that shown for the members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In this regard, and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is preferably formed into member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by first bending the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as by rotary bending using a die of desired dimension to achieve a desired formed resented by the angle A, of about 159 degrees and a center-line radius (CL) of about 4.34 inches. The formed wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is substantially symmetrical and bilateral, as shown in the top plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As will be noted, ends <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are substantially outside of the bend imparted as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The ends <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are preferably about 2 inches in length and are formed as explained below using press brake bending equipment to achieve the final configuration of the member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Returning to the initial manipulation of the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to achieve the desired formed degree of bend, it has been experienced that a formed degree of bend of 159 degrees for the member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be achieved using a die having a radius of about 3.195 inches and overbending the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a degree of bend A&prime;, shown in phantom, of about 206 degrees. Thus, the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> must be significantly bent past the desired formed degree of bend to impart the desired bend. The foregoing described bend and the similar bends described below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are preferably made using rotary bending apparatus and at room temperature.

</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is surprising that welds of suitable strength to achieve a face mask compliant with the relevant standards of the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) such as the NOCSAE Standard Method of Impact and Performance Requirements for Football Faceguards were achievable. It is known that titanium is highly reactive and would not be expected to provide suitable weld strength when welded in a reactive environment, such as in the presence of oxygen. As will be appreciated, the ability to achieve suitable weld strength in this manner achieves considerable cost savings as compared to welding in a non-reactive environment. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of the invention, it was observed that the settings set forth in Table 3 were important to achieving suitable weld strength. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> After welding, the guard is removed from the fixture and all wire terminations ground using silicon carbide sandpaper to a full radius to avoid sharp ends. The face guard is thereafter cleaned, primed with a bonding agent, such as a lacquer basic phenolic bonding agent, and coated with vinyl to a thickness of from about 0.02 to about 0.09 inches. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When used for football helmets, face guards in accordance with the invention should be tested for compliance with the afore-mentioned NOCSAE standard. Likewise, compliance with any other relevant standards or criteria should be determined dependent upon the intended use of the face guard. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A face guard constructed as described herein was observed to have a weight less than that of conventional steel wire and steel tubing face guards. For example, a similarly configured face guard made from steel wire of the same diameter (0.225 inches) would have a weight of over about 16 ounces, uncoated, and one made from steel tubing having an outside diameter of about 0.25 inches (i.d. 0.160 inches) would have a weight of at least about 11 ounces, uncoated. The foregoing described face guard of the invention has a weight of about 9 ounces, uncoated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It has also been observed that face guards made in accordance with the invention are more resistant to corrosion than conventional steel and steel tubing face guards. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The invention advances the art by enabling the production of face guards made of titanium wire which have desirable qualities and which may be produced in an economical and uncomplicated manner. It has been stated in the prior art that face guards could be made using titanium containing materials. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,713,082 states that the face mask thereof &ldquo;is usually cast with thin cross sections as a single piece and hardened using high strength alloys (e.g. titanium, 4140 steel, 4140 stainless steel, etc.).&rdquo; Col. 5, lines 2-4. U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,088 describes a face guard of metal tubes construction, with a metal tube <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> thereof made of steel, or of other metals or metal alloys (metal mixtures) such as aluminum, carbon, cobalt, chromium, iron, nickel, tin titanium and zinc. Co, 4, lines 7-1 1. It is believed that prior attempts to manufacture face guards using titanium containing materials have resulted in face guards that are unsuitable for their intended purpose and/or of such expense so at to be commercially unfeasible. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It has unexpectedly been discovered that face guards of desirable characteristics may be economically produced in accordance with the invention. For example, in accordance with the invention, it has been discovered that face guards having desirable characteristics may be manufactured using Grade 2, commercially pure titanium wire, having a diameter of from about 0.21 to about 0.24 inches, most preferably from about 0.224 to about 0.225 inches. For the purposes of the invention, it was observed that the selection of this particular material in the afore-mentioned diameter range was important to achieving the purposes of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention has been provided for purposes of illustration only, and it is understood that numerous modifications or alterations may be made in and to the illustrated embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to gloves for the human hand which are worn when playing sports such as baseball, softball, and the like. More particularly, this invention relates to a batting glove specifically designed to improve grip, comfort, protection, and performance of a wearer. However, this invention has broader implications and may be advantageously employed in other applications requiring protection of the hands. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Glove construction for protection of the human hand is well known. In addition, there are a number of patents which teach gloves claimed to be particularly useful as batting gloves. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,175,226 teaches a dress glove construction which completely covers the fingers and which includes resiliently expandable materials in selected areas to accommodate hands of different sizes. In contrast, U.S. Pat. No. 4,561,122 teaches a protective glove which has a wrap around construction for a protective glove which leaves the thumb and fingers ends exposed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,345,609 teaches a protective glove which includes shock absorbing cells disposed at selected portions along the top of the glove. U.S. Pat. No. 5,790,980 teaches a hand glove with a polyurethane foam pad in the palm portion of the glove. Other references attempt to provide a sport glove for supporting and stabilizing the wrist and hand. Current gloves protect the bony prominence areas of the hand. Although hand protection from direct shocks and abrasions is found in gloves of the current art, what is needed is a batting glove which provides improved grip, comfort and performance by unloading bony prominences, unloading pulleys and tendons, and improving finger and knuckle motion of the hand of a wearer by providing preselected thicknesses of preselected materials specifically chosen to protect the wearer from injury from distributed shocks in hitting a ball with a bat, and the attendant risk of long-term injury to the aforementioned bones, ligaments, pulleys, tendons, etc., by repetitive swinging of bats and hitting of balls. </paragraph>

The thumb <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> includes the flexor tendon (flexor pollicis longus) <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the three pulleys <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the thumb <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>; an A1 pulley <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, A2 pulley <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and A3 pulley <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The A2 pulley <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is the most important for function and is attached to the proximal phalanx <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the thumb <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The respective pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> are also shown for each of the: index finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, long finger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, ring finger <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, and small finger <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has five pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>; an A1 pulley <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, A3 pulley <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, and A5 pulley <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. The A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are considered to be the most important for function. The A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is attached to the proximal phalanx <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is attached to the middle phalanx <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The A1 pulley <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is near the MCP joint <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the A3 pulley <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is near the PIP joint <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the A5 pulley <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is near the DIP joint <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The flexor tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are shown as one unit for each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, but actually there are two flexor tendons to each unit. They are the flexor digitorum superficialis and the flexor digitorum profundus (shown as one, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). These tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> travel underneath the pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and attach to the distal phalanx <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> move back and forth below the pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, via muscles (not shown) attached to the proximal end of the tendons. This movement of the tendon <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> produces finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> flexion. The pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> prevent the flexor tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> from bowstringing or moving away from the bone with finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> flexion. If the pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> are damaged and no longer function, the tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> will bowstring with a resultant significant loss of finger motion as well as grip strength. As such, pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, especially the A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and the A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, are very important and must be preserved and protected as much as possible. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, protective padding <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is placed in an anatomically designed fashion over the A2 and A4 pulley regions. When the A2 and A4 pulleys <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are preserved, adequate finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> motion and grip strength is maintained. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an adjustable, disposable garment protector useful to protect the garments of a user from spills, dropped food and the like during the consumption of food and beverages, particularly fast food beverages. The invention also relates to a convertible food bag and a method for packaging the disposable garment protector and a method for disposing of the disposable garment protector and its contents after use. </paragraph>

</section>

<section>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE MENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Garment protectors have been used to protect the front of infants during feeding or dining and diners eating particularly messy foods such as lobsters and the like for many years. However, most such garment protectors simply consist of a cloth-like garment protector supported at the back of the neck of a user and do nothing to catch liquids or foods which may be spilled on the garment protector and pass downwardly over the surface of the garment protector and onto the garments of the user. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Such garment protectors do not serve the needs of modern consumers who frequently purchase food at fast food drive-ins or drive-throughs for consumption in an automotive vehicle while moving on crowded roadways and the like. Garment protectors for such use should not only be easily disposable but they should also provide a means for containing any waste materials spilled and provide for a method of disposing of both any spilled food particles, liquids and the like as well as the garment protector itself after the user has finished dining. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a continuing search has been directed to the development of a disposable garment protector which protects the garments of a user while dining in automobiles, school cafeterias, offices, picnicking, or like activities and provides for the disposal of any spilled or dropped food particles, liquids or packaging and for the disposal of the garment protector itself. </paragraph>

</section>

<section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, an adjustable disposable garment protector is provided and comprises a protector support adapted to support the garment protector from the neck of a user; a protector cover having a front surface and a back surface, a first side and a second side, a first and a second end and supported at its first end by the protector support in a position covering a front portion of the chest and stomach of the user; and, a pouch positioned on the second end of the protector cover, the pouch having a top end and a bottom end, a front and a back and being formed to fold to one of a first closed position for storage and a second opened position having its top end opened and positioned to collect particulates and liquids moving downwardly along the front surface of the garment protector in use. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The garment protector may also be fabricated as a convertible food bag which is convertible into an adjustable disposable garment protector, the convertible food bag comprising a food bag having a front and a back, a first side and a second side, a top and a bottom, a disposable garment protector support adapted to support the disposable garment protector from the neck of a user, a pouch formed by a lower portion of the bag and having a top and a bottom end, a front and a back and being formed to fold to one of a closed position for storage and a second opened position having its top end open and a tearable perforation or a cut across the front, first side and second side of the bag so that the bag above the top of the pouch is foldable to a closed position to form a protector cover having a front surface and a back surface, a first side and a second side, a first and a second end and supported at its first end by the protector support in a position covering a front portion of the chest and stomach of the user.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the description of the Figures the same numbers will be used throughout to refer to the same or similar components. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> an adjustable, disposable garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown. Garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adapted to support garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in position about the neck of a user. Support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes at least one perforation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (two are shown) which are included to permit rapid removal of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the event of an emergency. Perforations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are positioned near the upper part of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which would be near the back of the user. Perforations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> could also be placed at any place along the length of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also includes a plurality of creases <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which may be bent at a first crease and doubled back at another crease and stuck to adhesive patches <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to shorten support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At least one adhesive patch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is positioned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and more clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to facilitate shortening support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in this fashion. Support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> defines an opening <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in its center which is the space occupied by the neck of the user as the disposable garment protector is positioned for use. This center section may comprise a napkin material which is readily removed by breaking perforations surrounding center <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or it may comprise a sheet containing games for the amusement of children or adults and the like. The center napkin or the like is perforated for removal without tearing perforations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The center <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as well as other surfaces of the disposable garment protector, may be used for advertising, decorative materials or the like. In fact it is contemplated that most of the exposed surfaces of the disposable garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be used for advertising or decorative materials. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is supported by support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is configured to cover a front portion of the chest and stomach of the user. The protector cover section desirably comprises an absorbent towel or napkin-like soft, absorbent material <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on its front surface. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 12</cross-reference>, a water-impervious layer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is desirably positioned on a portion of a back <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> of disposable garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Typically the impervious layer extends behind the lower portion of garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for example below a dotted line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extends downwardly to its bottom <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to be the same as a bottom <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of a pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a front <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a back <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a first side <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a second side <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and is positioned generally at the bottom of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A plurality of creases <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be positioned in protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a folded position so that protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be pulled downwardly to unfold creases <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to lengthen protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is generally a fold-out pouch, is shown to fold out in a fashion similar to the bottom of a paper bag. As shown more fully in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plurality of folds <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are positioned at sides <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so that pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be folded to a closed position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> with its bottom positioned near a front surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> By reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, fold-out inner pouches <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are shown by dotted lines. These pouches may be positioned to be folded out by the user inside pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or designed as an integral part of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to fold out as desired by the user to hold barbeque sauce, catsup, salad dressing, or the like. The use of the inner pouches is optional but may be desirable in many instances. Further, a plurality of fold-out inner pouches may be used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> side view of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is shown. Adhesive strip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown in combination with creases <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to shorten protector cover <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with creases <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> shown in a closed (initial) position. Pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown in its open position. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown in a closed position and folded against front <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Creases <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are in their open position to lengthen protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an alternate configuration of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown. This pouch folds differently but includes a fold <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and collapses against protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for storage. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which also collapses against the front of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for storage. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an alternate embodiment of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown. The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is basically a slipover design where support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> constitutes a single strap which may be adjusted by creases and adhesives. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> two straps are shown. The straps are joined to a first side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a second side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of a first end <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (top) of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and are overlapped with an end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of a first strap and an end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of a second strap. The straps can be joined by VELCRO, adhesives or as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> by a snap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or the like. In both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> perforations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are shown. A variety of fasteners can be used such as VELCRO, adhesives, snaps, buttons, tying, the use of a continuous strap with a slipover fit and the like. Such variations are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> plurality of perforations <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are shown in each side of a strap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A single perforation could be used, and two straps could be used but for convenience a plurality of perforations is shown in a slip-over strap. In this embodiment, strap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be shortened by tearing one of the perforations on each side and moving the end (strap tear end) of the strap removed at the perforation to engage a adhesive shown at <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. By selection of the desired perforation, strap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be shortened to any desired length. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In other respects, the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is similar to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> food bag convertible to become a disposable garment protector is shown. The food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has a top <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and a front <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and first and second sides <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>respectively. A support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as discussed in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is positioned to extend above back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, during use of the bag, support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is bent downwardly along the back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. In this configuration the bag is readily used to serve food and the like. Bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Further bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a cut <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or a perforation which is easily tearable along front <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and sides <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, but strong enough to permit use of the bag as a container. This permits the bag sections above top <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to be separated and folded back against front <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A clip or tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> made of a suitable deformable material such as treated paper or the like is positioned on the top of back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and is used as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> for deformation to hold the collapsed upper sections of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in a collapsed position against front <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be of the same material as bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and may be insertable into a slot <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; inside <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>A of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for mating engagement with tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, to hold the collapsed upper sections of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in a collapsed position. In this configuration, the bag is readily used as a disposable garment protector. The bag may also be fabricated from a clear plastic or the like so that the contents of the bag can be seen by the purchaser. Bags of this type are also suitable for conversion to a garment protector as discussed above. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12 a</cross-reference> cross-section of the back <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shown. A front layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> comprises a soft, absorbent material such as a towel or napkin-like material which has suitable strength to form support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A backing <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is positioned by bonding it to the back of the front layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. This configuration permits the bag to be fabricated economically by placing the water repellant material only on the lower portion of the disposable garment protector where it is needed rather than behind the front of the entire disposable garment protector. Of course, no such backing is required when a plastic bag is used. Such fabricaton techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Various adhesives have been referred to in the discussion of the present invention. These adhesives are adhesive strips which are preferably covered with a peelable or otherwise readily removable covering so that the adhesive is not activated until it is desired by the user to do so. Such adhesives are readily available and form no part of the present invention except as they may function in conjunction with other components of the collapsible garment protector. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, an adhesive strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is shown near the top of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This strip is used to retain the disposable garment protector in a rolled-up position when the user has finished with it. When the user has finished his meal, an adhesive strip <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is used to close pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The pouch then contains any spilled or discarded materials or the like which have been placed in pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can also be used for the disposal of napkins, empty packages and the like consistent with the size of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. After pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has been closed, the garment protector may be rolled into a tight roll and retained in the tight roll by use of adhesive strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This permits the economical use of space in a vehicle with the waste materials from the meal contained in the disposable garment protector. Similarly tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> may be formed as an adhesive tab and used in a similar fashion or an adhesive tab may be used in lieu of tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> By the use of the present invention, a user may safely purchase and consume fast food products while occupying a vehicle or the like without risk of soiling the users&apos; garments. After the disposable garment protector has been used, it can then be utilized to store spills and other refuse from the consumed meal in a fashion consistent with the maintenance of neatness in the vehicle and the like until an opportunity to dispose of the disposable garment protector is available. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The disposable garment protectors may be stored in flat containers from which they are removed sequentially by use of a tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The tab in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is adapted to be grasped by a user of the disposable garment protector, or a third party dispersing the disposal garment protector to a user, for the removal of a disposable garment protector from a storage box, drawer or the like in which the disposable garment protectors are positioned as flat stackable disposable garment protectors. Alternatively, the disposable garment protector may be folded at lines such as line <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and at perforations <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> if folded with pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> facing downwardly along line <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> with support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being folded upwardly and over the remaining portions of disposable garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at perforation <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime;. The disposable garment protectors may be placed in a smaller container and again may be removed by grasping tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which may comprise a covered adhesive tab. This permits the storage of disposable garment protectors in a smaller container which may be somewhat taller but occupies a smaller horizontal space than when the disposable garment protectors are stacked in the flattened form. Many variations in the packaging of disposable products, such as the adjustable disposable garment protectors, are possible and well-known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Having thus described the present invention by reference to certain of its preferred embodiments, it is pointed out that many variations and modifications are possible within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is broadly concerned with therapy apparel for children diagnosed with sensory integration dysfunction and/or impaired motor development. The apparel is designed to be worn during the course of a therapy session, and has been found to yield many benefits to children under such treatment. The preferred therapy apparel includes a top worn over the shoulders and trunk of a child with a series of flexible, stretchable elastic straps designed for selective placement around the child&apos;s feet and knees during different therapy exercises, and for grasping and lateral extension by the child. The top is adorned with fanciful theme decorations thereon to arouse the child&apos;s interest and fulfill play needs. The overall apparel further includes a cape and specialized, close-fitting headgear, which again are appropriately theme-decorated. The headgear is designed to permit the child to attach various fanciful accouterments to excite the child and enhance motor skill development. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Sensory integrative dysfunction is a developmental disorder defined by deficits in the central processing of proprioceptive, tactile, and vestibular sensory inputs that are not attributable to either peripheral or cortical central nervous system dysfunction. The proprioceptive sense refers to components of muscles, joints, and tendons that provide a person with a subconscious awareness of body position and movement. Children with sensory integration dysfunction may have difficulty maintaining balance in relation to environmental demands and have difficulty with tasks that require opposing muscle groups to work in a coordinated fashion, such as wringing out a wash cloth or pouring milk from a heavy container. The tactile sense interprets applied stimuli such as touch, pressure, pain, and temperature, through tactile receptors found throughout the skin. Some children are overly sensitive to touch, particularly light touch and have a tendency to react negatively and with extreme emotion to some tactile sensations. On the other hand, some children crave tactile input, touching and seeking out input. The vestibular sense is responsible for awareness of body position and movement in space, postural tone and equilibrium, and stabilization of the eyes in space during head movements. The vestibular receptors are located in the inner ear and are stimulated by movement of the head and by gravity. Children with sensory integration dysfunction may have balance difficulties and cannot tolerate or interpret movement, while others seem to crave movement opportunities. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Sensory integration theory postulates that intervention through therapy provides enhanced sensory experience within the context of a meaningful, self-directed activity in order to elicit an adaptive behavior. The result is enhanced sensory integration and, in turn, enhanced learning. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One method of proprioceptive and tactile sensory stimulation is deep pressure or deep touch pressure. Deep touch pressure is the type of surface pressure that is exerted in most types of firm touching, holding, and stroking. One investigator observed this need for deep pressure from a girl with autism as she would hug her mother with strong, firm hugs. Her mother indicated that her child favored clothing that covered her limbs and was made from cotton knit fabric. Her mother would often dress the child in a jumper or skirt over cotton knit, flowered longjohns. The need to cover the limbs with fabric that hugs the body is characteristic of the child who needs continuous tactile input. In contrast, a four-year-old male with autism was observed who did not like clothing. He would remove his shirt, socks, and shoes, and pull his pant legs up as far as possible. These are characteristic of tactile defensiveness. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Weighted vests, weighted collars, weighted arms and leg bands, lap and shoulder weights, and weighted quilts are available for treating deep pressure needs. One investigator conducted a pilot study applying weighted vests with two samples, children with autism and children without autism. The non-autistic children reported that wearing the vest made them feel sleepy, but showed no appreciable change in pulse or blood pressure; whereas, the children with autism had measurable drops in both pulse rate and blood pressure reading. While the wearing of weighted vests are increasing in elementary schools and therapy treatment programs, the outcomes of wearing weighted vests are largely anecdotal and few parameters exist to guide the use of the vests. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Gloves and pressure vests have been shown to reduce self-stimulatory behaviors of a young girl with autism. Similarly, self-injurious and self-stimulating behaviors of a boy with autism were reduced while wearing arm splints and elastic bandages. A calming effect provided by the direct pressure has been reported. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An adult with autism has reported that deep pressure applied to her body provides a calming effect. A squeeze machine was designed to provide great amounts of pressure over her body. The squeeze machine&apos;s pressure also had a relaxing effect on adults without disability. Use of the squeeze machine also led to a reduction in hyperactivity in four of nine children. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The foregoing indicates that deep pressure and tactile input is calming for children with sensory impairments and that apparel and textile products may be used as therapeutic aids. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing expedients have been used in the past in an attempt to provide appropriate therapy for children diagnosed with sensory integration dysfunction, the prior apparel and the like has not fulfilled the play and imaginative needs of small children; moreover, the prior therapy garments do not generally provide the full range of desirable therapy inputs for the treatment of sensory integration dysfunctions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the problems outlined above and provides therapy apparel for small children diagnosed with sensory integration dysfunction and impaired motor development. Broadly speaking, the therapy apparel includes a flexible top adapted to be worn over the shoulders and trunk of a child requiring therapy, with the top having upper shoulder sections and a neck opening therebetween, and front and rear panels depending from the shoulder sections and presenting lower margins. The top includes a pair of flexible, stretchable first straps extending below the panel lower margins with each first strap being of a length for selective coupling with a respective one of the child&apos;s feet while the child is standing. In this orientation, the first straps cause the top and straps to be pulled downwardly to provide deep pressure therapy input. Preferably, each of the first straps is in the form of a continuous loop passing adjacent a shoulder section of the top and with the lower end of each loop adapted for passing under a respective foot of the child; in this way, upwardly directed forces are generated to give upward pressure and proprioceptive input. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In further preferred forms, the top has a pair of flexible, stretchable second straps likewise extending below the lower margin of the top with each second strap being of a length for selective coupling with a respective one of the child&apos;s knees when the child is in a tall kneeling position; these second straps are also configured to cause the top strap to be pulled downwardly in this orientation. The second straps are likewise in the form of continues loops which pass adjacent a shoulder section and with the lower end of the loops adapted for coupling with the child&apos;s knees, to generated upwardly forces. Finally, the top also includes a third pair of flexible, stretchable, loop-type lateral straps each selectively extensible in opposed lateral directions beyond the side sections of the top and grasped by the child. These lateral straps when extended cause the top to be pulled in corresponding lateral directions, creating resistance against the child&apos;s hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder joints and coordinating muscles. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The front and rear panels of the top are preferably provided with fanciful theme decorations thereon, such as insects (e.g. beetles), aquatic animals with fins, scales and eyes, animals having horns, ears, noses, eyes and tails, royalty with crowns, and wands, workers such as firemen, policemen, mail carriers, construction workers and cowboys, and shapes, colors and textures of various types (squares, circles, triangles, ovals and the like). Furthermore, in order to provide a further measure of deep pressure input, the front and back panels of the top are provided with pockets which receive weights of various sizes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The preferred apparel also includes a cape to be worn over the top with the cape having a neckpiece and a pair of opposed, outwardly extending wing sections, the latter each having a handhold. The outer surface of the cape is equipped with differently manipulable objects which can be grasped and used by the child, in order to provide fine motor development. The outer surface of the cape is also preferably decorated in a manner corresponding to the decorations provided on the apparel top </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Finally, the therapy apparel includes headgear which is stretchable and equipped with a chin strap so that the headgear may be drawn tightly around the child&apos;s head. The headgear further has a plurality of different, fanciful accouterments each attachable to the exterior surface of the headgear at the discretion of the child. For this purpose, a headgear preferably has a central panel and opposed side panels, with stretchable fabric interconnecting the panels; the outer surface of the panels, and the corresponding ends of the accouterments, have mating hook and loop Velcro&reg; fabric sections. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The therapy apparel of the invention allows full body movement by the child to facilitate participation in all occupational activities and use of occupational/physical therapy equipment. Moreover, the apparel provides opportunities for active proprioceptive input, allows for passive and deep pressure proprioceptive input, promotes use of equipment to provide vestibular input and generates desirable tactile input. Use of the therapy apparel promotes gross, fine and perceptual motor skills along with motor planning up to three stages, and enhances transitions without behavior resistance from the child between activities, thus aiding in the wearer&apos;s self-organization and attention to task. Finally, the apparel meets the play needs of the child, with structures and forms revolving around play themes favored by children.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, and particularly <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, therapy apparel broadly referred to by the numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided, which is worn by a child <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Broadly speaking, the apparel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a sleeveless fabric top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be worn over the shoulders and trunk of the child <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a fabric cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a flexible, close-fitting headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) includes a pair of upper padded raglan shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a neckhole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> therebetween, and a pair of depending front and rear panels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> depending from the shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A pair of large arm holes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed below the shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, with respective side sections <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> below the corresponding arm holes. The panels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the side sections <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> form a continuous lower margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as shown. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The entire top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is constructed to have a lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed of appropriately sewn-together fabric (e.g., cotton spandex knit), an interlining to internally organize the straps (polyester knit interfacing), as well as a fabric exterior <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is likewise sewn-together. The fabric exterior <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed using any desired fabric such as gold spandex, and is adorned with fanciful theme decorations, such as a &ldquo;beetle&rdquo; design on the front and rear panels. In addition, a series of openings are provided in the fabric <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for receipt of stretchable straps which extend between the outer fabric exterior <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In particular, lower slit openings <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are provided in the front and rear panels adjacent margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, along with upper slit openings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of each shoulder section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Elongated lateral slits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are provided on the front and rear panels adjacent the armholes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Finally, somewhat shorter lateral slits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are formed in the side sections <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> accommodate a total of three pairs of elongated, continuous-loop stretchable straps formed of elastic, which extend through corresponding channels in the top which are interlined with polyester knit interfacing. Specifically, a first pair of leg straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extend through the slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, so that the upper ends of the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> overly the corresponding shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and extend below margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, each of the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a short, flexible elastic segment <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> adjacent the lower end thereof, defining corresponding foot-receiving openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A second set of somewhat shorter knee straps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are threaded through the slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> but lie within the confines of the longer leg straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> have a hanging length of about 27 &frac12; inches when relaxed, whereas the knee straps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> have a relaxed hanging length of about 20&frac12; inches. A hold-down strap <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is secured at the lower margin side in order to hold straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> when not in use. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A pair of upper and lower lateral continuous loop straps <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are also supported by the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and in the illustrated embodiment have a relaxed length of 23 inches. As illustrated, the upper strap <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extends through the arcuate slits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, whereas the lower strap <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> passes through the slits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A hold down strap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is secured to the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the lower sections of armholes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in order to hold straps <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in place when not in use. The hold down straps <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are selectively releasable via hook and loop (Velcro&reg;) material respectively secured to the inner surface of the straps <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the outer fabric of the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the interlining <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> includes pieces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>preferably formed of polyester knit interfacing which are attached to lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The upright pieces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extend from the shoulder regions downwardly towards margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and are sewn with stitching <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to define corresponding open-ended strap channels <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which receive the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (straps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The piece <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>overlies the pieces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and is attached by stitching <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> defining upper and lower open-ended, lateral channels <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which respectively receive straps <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Although not illustrated, it will be appreciated that the rear panel of the lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is also equipped with interlining as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, so that the loop straps <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are supported front and rear. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Each of the front and rear panels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is equipped with a pair of side-by side open top pockets <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> which are designed to receive weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Such weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably correspond with the fanciful theme of the surface decoration of the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For example, in the case of the &ldquo;beetle&rdquo; theme, the weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> would be in the form of baby bugs having a surface decoration including fabric &ldquo;wings&rdquo; as well as extensible &ldquo;feelers&rdquo; (not shown). The weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be provided in different sizes (e.g. &frac14; and &frac12; pound) are preferably formed of fabric and are filled with metal pellets or other weighting material. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The overall apparel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a fabric cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having an exterior fabric surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and an inner lining surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Again, the exterior surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is advantageously consistent in its design with the fanciful theme of top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, this exterior surface would have a similar &ldquo;beetle&rdquo; design along the central portion of the cape outer surface. In more detail, the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a central neckpiece <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> made up of a pair of selectively interconnectable straps <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> provided with matable hook and loop fabric pieces <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In addition, the cape has a central section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> as well as outwardly extending wing sections <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The inner surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the cape has a pair of hand holds <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> on the wing sections <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which can be grasped by the child to extend the cape, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The inner lining of the cape has a pair of Velcro&reg; straps designed to mate with corresponding Velcro&reg; straps <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> provided on the shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The outer fabric surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is also provided with differently manipulable objects which can be manipulated and used by the child. Specifically, the central section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> has a zippered pocket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> as well as an adjacent button-closed pocket <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The wing section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a lacing assembly <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> made up of a pair of elongated fabric sections <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> provided with eyelets <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>; a lacing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is threaded through the eyelets <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and conventionally knotted. The wing section <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the other hand has a zipper assembly <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> made up of a pair of fabric sections <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> interconnected by an elongated separating zipper <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is designed as a close-fitting head covering and includes a pair of padded side panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a padded central panel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are formed of padded fabric with the exterior surfaces thereof formed of Velcro&reg; loop material. A pair of elongated, stretchable elastic sections <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> interconnect the central panel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and side panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so as to allow a stretch fit on the head of a child. A chin strap <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a mating Velcro&reg; outer end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extends between the side panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and allows the headgear to be drawn tightly around the child&apos;s head. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is also provided with a plurality of different, fanciful accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> each having a base <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> formed of mating Velcro&reg; fabric, allowing the respective accouterments to be attached to any desired point on the panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, at the discretion of the child. The accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be of virtually any appropriate configuration, consistent with the fanciful decorations on the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, it will be seen that the accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> include wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, eyes <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, antennae <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of various sizes and configurations, and small weighted bugs <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In use, the therapy apparel is donned by the child, with assistance from the therapist. First, the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is put on, with the therapist selecting appropriate weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for insertion into the pockets <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Thereupon, the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are donned, with the chin strap of the latter being drawn to ensure that the headgear is in close fitting relationship to the child&apos;s head. The child is then encouraged to decorate the headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> at the child&apos;s discretion. This is of course readily accomplished owing to the construction of the accouterments having bases <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which are attachable to the outer surface of the headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides low level protection and sensory input and integration (tactile, proprioceptive and vestibular). The opportunity to decorate the headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> gives motor development opportunities, appeals to the play needs of the child and enhances the opportunity for social interaction. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Actual observations of children wearing the therapy apparel of the invention demonstrates that the garments enable children to function at a higher attention level and skill level during therapy. One subject had difficulty managing his behavior, organizing himself and staying on task. When wearing the apparel, there was a noticeable improvement in the subject&apos;s behavior, which is believed to have occurred because the elastic straps and/or weights provided the correct amount of arousal, modulation and discrimination, all leading to skill output. Another major benefit was that use of the Bootstraps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> notably decreased the subject&apos;s toe walking. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The fanciful design on the apparel promoted the use of vestibular integrating suspended equipment. Several subjects pretended they were &ldquo;flying&rdquo; and used suspended swings as flying vehicles. The duration of time the subjects spent in the suspended equipment increased with continued wearing of the therapy apparel. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A variety of tactile opportunities were provided by the various different fabrics and other different materials used in the construction of the apparel. As the children interacted with the apparel they received tactile input from the elastic straps, hugging the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to their bodies, throwing the bug weights, placing items in the top and cape pockets, and manipulating the cape&apos;s zippers, button and lacing assembly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Fine and perceptual motor skill activity in the subjects increased by interaction with the cape&apos;s fastening system and the zippers, button, button hole, Velcro&reg; sections and lacing. Resistance-free transitions were observed between gross motor and fine motor activities and motor planning was promoted by using the cape to store fine motor activities. The subjects planned activities retrieved the objects for the activities, stored objects in the cape&apos;s pockets, participated in gross motor activity and then removed the objects from the cape&apos;s pockets for fine motor activity. Using the top and cape pockets promoted smooth transitions and organization of the wearer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The play needs of the wearers were satisfied with the &ldquo;bug superhero&rdquo; theme, and the apparel stimulated the desire to engage in imaginative play while also allowing the therapist to incorporate therapy goal activities. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>

<section>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a Martial Arts Gi or practice uniform having highly visible patches or targets which will lie superimposed over the most vital points of contact on the body of the wearer. The combatants, during practice, may then accurately aim non-contact kicks and punches at these most vital points on their opponent&apos;s body so as to practice rendering their opponent incapacitated in the most efficient manner. </paragraph>

</section>

<section>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In many of the martial arts, for example, jiu jitsu, karate, etc., participants prepare for engaging an opponent in unarmed combat. Such preparation often requires years of diligent training and practice in order to become effective. The participants become disciplined, coordinated and generally more physically fit and potentially lethal during repetitive exercises for example those simulating the striking attack upon an opponent or the defense to such an attack upon the participant. In that the combatants are unarmed, the combatants will each have the same areas of vulnerability inherent in the human form, all other things being equal. The successful combatant will be the one who can strike most effectively through the opponent&apos;s defenses so as to land an accurately focused forceful blow, kick or the like to vulnerable points on the opponent&apos;s body. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the prior art of which applicant is aware, it is known to train for martial arts combat by physically striking at resilient targets which are meant to simulate striking parts of an opponent&apos;s body. It is also known to provide resilient padding for combatant&apos;s bodies so that the force from blows which are exchanged is absorbed by the padding. As an example of the former, applicant is aware of U.S. Pat. No. 4,991,231 which issued to Swift on Feb. 12, 1991 for a Karate Target Pad. As an example of the latter, applicant is aware of U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,649 which issued Mar. 26, 1996 to Queppet for a Martial Arts Training Pad and Blocking Shield. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Applicant is also aware of attempts in the prior art to provide targets on padding used for martial arts training, for example such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,866,909 which issued to DeSantis on Feb. 18, 1975 for a Protective Garment for Karate with Force Indicating Members Thereon, and Canadian laid-open Patent Application No. 2,261,472 to Dabney, laid open Aug. 13, 1999 and entitled &ldquo;Protective Target Apparatus to Aid in the Practice of Martial Arts&rdquo;. With respect to the DeSantis teaching, it is taught to provide a uniform for combatants engaging in full-contact karate and the like, where the uniform consists of a helmet and a torso-protective garment having a plurality of pockets mounted on the helmet and the garment at positions corresponding to vulnerable parts of the covered portions of the combatants. Inflated plastic bags are placed into the pockets so as to be ruptured upon impact by a blow of predetermined force. The ruptured plastic bag emits a noise indicating the successful strike. What is neither taught nor suggested is the use of flexible targets, such as those taught herein, which may be distributed over a uniform so as to cover many of the vulnerable points not located on the torso, and which would prove to be cumbersome to cover using the device of DeSantis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Applicant notes that DeSantis does not suggest covering the arms and legs of the combatant with a protective garment having air-bag receiving pockets, as such would likely not prove practical and would inhibit the freedom of motion of those limbs. Contrary to the teaching of DeSantis, it is taught herein, and it is one object of the present invention to provide, a Gi which, as with conventional Gis, covers the arms and legs of the user. The Gi has positioned thereon, flexible and soft targets indicating the vulnerable spots on not only the torso, but also the limbs of the user. In the present invention, the target-bearing Gi is intended to provide a training device for non-contact training so that padding such as that taught by DeSantis is not required. </paragraph>

</section>

<section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Reference to Martial Arts herein includes karate, kung-fu, tae kwon do, judo, jujitsu and the like, and is not intended to be limiting. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The kicks and punches used to achieve efficient dominance over an opponent must during practice be directed to the most vital or vulnerable points on the human body. The Gi of the present invention has highly visible indicia such as patches or targets, which provide a visual target during practice sessions for locating these vital strike points as the opponent takes evasive and counter-attacking action. The targets aid in the non-contact practicing of accurate kicks and punches to these areas. Advantageously, in one embodiment of the invention, the Gi is reversible so that a conventionally appearing Gi may be turned inside-out to expose the targets for non-contact practice. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Such targets may be mounted on or integrated with the fabric of the Gi, on one of its sides, by a number of different methods such as by dyeing, by sewing, by silk-screening or other printing methods, or by ironing on such separate targets as will have heat-activated adhesive on one side. Such targets may conform in both size and shape to the vulnerable area of the body and may be raised, textured or padded. In alternative embodiments the targets may include sensors to detect successful strikes and/or to detect the force of such strikes. The sensors may communicate such strike information electrically or otherwise for gathering, collation and processing by a remote digital processor, for example a remote laptop computer. Such information, once processed, may be used to monitor training or matches between combatants. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The targets, then, may be situated on the Gi so as to indicate the locations of the following 12 strike points: Trapezius Muscle, Triceps Muscle, Biceps Muscle, Brachioradial Muscle, Abdomen, Groin, Medial Quadriceps Muscle, Lateral Quadriceps Muscle, Medial Calf Muscle, Lateral Calf Muscle, Kidney and Axilla. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The Martial Arts Gi of the present invention is thus a garment having highly visible patches or targets attached or formed in an outer surface, where the garment may be reversible so that the targets are on one side only, that side generally being the inside reversible surface thereof. These targets are positioned on the surface of the garment so as to lie superimposed over the most vital or vulnerable points or strike zones on the body of the wearer. During practice sessions, the garment may be worn so as to expose the targets, that is, so that they are visible to an opponent. The combatants may then aim their non-contacting practice kicks and punches more accurately at these targets or strike zones so as to practice striking the most vital points of their opponent&apos;s body. By having visual target indicia for reference on the opponent during practice sessions, co-ordination and accuracy may more rapidly improve. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In summary, the martial arts Gi of the present invention includes a flexible fabric garment adapted to be worn by a user, where the garment has a plurality of flexible target indicia on an outwardly exposed outer surface of the garment. The garment when so worn covers at least the torso and may cover the limbs of a user. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The target indicia are positioned on the garment so as to correspond to the position of vulnerable target areas on the user when wearing the garment. Vulnerable target areas means areas on the user which are vulnerable to forceful impacts such as kicks or punches. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Where the garment covers the limbs of the user, the target indicia include target indicia on the limb-covering portions of the garment so as to correspond to vulnerable target areas on the limbs of the user. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the garment is reversible. For example, the garment may comprise a jacket and a pair of pants. The target indicia may be sized and shaped to represent the size and shape of the corresponding vulnerable target areas of the user. For example, the target indicia may be fabric patches which are each generally round or obround and mounted to the garment so as to lie flush. The target indicia are preferably indicated by means for contrasting the indicia from the garment, for example by contrasting markings, color, texture, padding or appearance generally. The target indicia may include strike sensors.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As seen in the accompanying figures, the Martial Arts Gi or practice uniform <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is manufactured for example from a sturdy heavy grade cotton fabric so as to resist rips and tears during use. The Gi may generally comprise a separate jacket <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and trousers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The jacket has overlapping front panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>a which are retained in a closed position by a fabric belt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The Gi of the present invention has a reversible embodiment. In this embodiment, not intended to be limiting, when practice uniform or Gi <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is worn in its reversed position, i.e. turned inside-out as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the interior surface of the Gi is exposed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has positioned thereon target indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> indicating targets or strike zones. Target indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be attached to the fabric of the interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of Gi <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in any one of several suitable ways, such as by sewing, adhesive, or the like, or may be formed, printed or dyed onto the fabric. Target indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are superimposed over the most vital or vulnerable points on the body. The target indicia may be brightly coloured or otherwise adapted to contrast against Gi <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may generally conform in both size and shape to the corresponding target area of the body, which when accurately impacted with the requisite force, will disable the opponent. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The Gi may be reversed back to a conventional appearing Gi such as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> by once again turning the garment inside-out. In other embodiments the Gi may not be reversible, or may have different target patterns or differently sized targets depending on which side of the reversible Gi is exposed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The vital points of contact on the body over which, typically, strike zone targets may be superimposed are as follows: targets <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are located over the trapezius muscles, targets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> identify the triceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> identify the biceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> identify the brachioradial muscle, target <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> identifies the abdomen, target <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> identifies the groin, targets <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> identify the medial quadriceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> identify the lateral quadriceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> identify the medial calf muscle, targets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> identify the lateral calf muscle, targets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> identify the kidneys and targets <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> identify the axilla. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the foregoing disclosure, many alterations and modifications are possible in the practice of this invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of employing a sound insulated sleeve for quietly opening a wrapped product. Recently, a study was conducted to determine whether opening a candy bar wrapper slowly results in a reduction in noise emission over opening a candy bar wrapper quickly. The study concluded that either technique results in emission of an equivalent amount of noise. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As such, it has now been scientifically determined that opening a candy bar wrapper slowly within a feeder or stadium does nothing to diminish the disturbance of that act. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There has always been a need for some device that would permit one to quietly open a candy bar wrapper within a feeder or stadium. It is with this need in mind that the present invention was developed. </paragraph>

</section>

<section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of employing a sound insulated sleeve for quietly opening a wrapped product. The present invention includes the following interrelated objects, aspects and features: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (1) In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a sleeve is provided having an outer aesthetic covering lined with a sound absorbing material with the inner surfaces of the sound absorbing material being covered with a further covering. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (2) Each end of the sleeve is open and includes structure to cause the opening to gather about the wrists of the user when in use. One embodiment of such gathering consists of sealing means comprising elastic installed about the periphery of each opening and tending to compress the opening so that it gathers about the wrist of the user. In an alternative embodiment, the sealing means comprises a string such as a shoestring that may be threaded through an annular chamber, extending out through one or two openings formed in the end of the sleeve with the user pulling the string to tighten the opening about the wrist of the user. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (3) If desired, as an alternative, the inventive device can take the form of a container made of any desired shape such as spherical, rectangular cubic, square cubic, or any other desired configuration including two openings allowing access to the interior chamber by the hands of the user and some means to gather the periphery of each opening about the wrist of the user to seal the chamber with the hands of the user therein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (4) In any event, the inventive device in any one of its embodiments is employed by inserting a wrapped candy bar or other treat through one of the openings and into the internal chamber of the device. The hands are inserted through the respective openings and the openings are gathered in any suitable manner about the wrists to seal the enclosed chamber from emission of sound. The hands are used within the chamber to manipulate the candy bar to open the wrapper while preventing most, if not all, sound emission. Once the candy bar has been unwrapped, it may be removed along with the wrapper through one of the openings of the device and may be eaten. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As such, it is a first object of the present invention to provide a method of employing a sound insulated sleeve for quietly opening a wrapped product. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a method in which the openings of the sleeve are gathered so that they tightly surround the wrists of the user when the user&apos;s hands are placed within the chamber thereof. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such a method wherein such gathering is accomplished through elastic material. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such a method in which the gathering is provided through a circumferentially extending string. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide such a method in which the chamber is made in a polygonal shape such as, for example, rectangular cubic, square cubic and the like. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide such a method which is made in a spherical shape. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, aspects and features of the present invention will be better understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments when read in conjunction with the appended drawing figures.</paragraph>

<section>

<heading lvl="1">SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference, first, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a first embodiment of the device used in the present invention is generally designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is seen to include an outer aesthetic covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a further lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> wherein the sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the sleeve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes opposed openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which lead to an internal chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is gathered in a direction toward closing of the opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by a circumferential piece of elastic <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> suitably sewn onto the outer covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a piece of elastic <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is sewn about the periphery of the opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for the same purpose. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the preferred method of the present invention, the sound insulative layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitable material such as fiberglass, foam or any material that resists transmission therethrough of sound waves. Put another way, the material for the lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should efficiently absorb sound waves. Such materials are well known. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the operation of the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a user inserts a wrapped product such as a candy bar within the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and inserts their hands into the respective openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with the elastic pieces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> causing the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, respectively, to gather about the wrists of the user to create sealing means causing the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to become sealed and air tight. The user then manipulates their hands to open the candy bar wrapper and remove the piece of candy therefrom. This having been accomplished, the candy bar and its wrapper may easily be removed through one or the other of the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, whereupon the wrapper may be discarded and the candy bar may be consumed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an alternative construction of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in which like elements are referred to with like primed reference numerals. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes an outer aesthetic covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, a sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; and an inner lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime;. The opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime; leads to a chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. Instead of the elastic <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, an elongated string <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided that is threaded circumferentially through the outer covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; via the openings <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> shown. Such a structure is similar to the well known drawstrings used to tighten the waistband of a pair of sweatpants. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Similar structure is provided for the opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; (not shown). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The operation of the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is similar to that of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. After the hands are inserted into the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;, the string <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a corresponding string (not shown) with respect to the opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; (not shown) are tightened to cause the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; to be air tight about the wrists of the user. Thereafter, operation is the same as that of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, although after the product wrapper has been opened, the strings including the string <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are suitably loosened to allow the hands to be removed from the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment of the present invention designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and seen to include an outer housing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that is made in a rectangular cubic or square cubic configuration. One face <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> includes two openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> therethrough corresponding to the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be provided with a tendency to gather about the wrists of the user through the use of elastic such as is disclosed with respect to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> or with a drawstring such as the drawstring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> or through any other suitable means. Alternatively, the openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be respectively provided in opposed or adjacent panels of the housing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in which the housing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is generally spherical or elliptical and the openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are adjacent to one another. Of course, the openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be placed on opposed portions of the housing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or separated from one another by any desired degree. As is the case with the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may tend to gather about the wrists of the user in any suitable way such as is disclosed hereinabove. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In all of the embodiments of the present invention set forth hereinabove, the outer covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and inner lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be omitted provided the sound insulative material such as that designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has the structural integrity to enclose the hands and wrists of the user without damage thereto. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, if either the covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or the lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or both are to be included, they each may be made of any suitable material such as cloth or plastic or rubber. The sole purpose for the covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to provide an aesthetic cover for the device and, if necessary, to provide structural integrity to the sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The sole purpose for the lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is to maintain the structural integrity of the sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and, if necessary, to preclude engagement of the lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the hands of the user. For example, where the lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is made of fiberglass material, it would be best to avoid direct contact with that material by the hands of the user to avoid fiberglass splinters from entering the hands of the user. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As should be evident, the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> operate in a similar manner to those of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The user inserts a wrapped product inside the housing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> through one of the openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and thereafter inserts their hands into the openings with the openings gathering about the wrists thereof to provide a sealed chamber. The wrapper is manipulated and opened and is thereafter removed through one of the openings along with the unwrapped product. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Of course, as should be understood by those skilled in the art, the wrapped product can be placed within the sound insulated chamber after one hand is inserted therein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As such, an invention has been disclosed in terms of preferred embodiments thereof which fulfill each and every one of the objects of the invention as set forth hereinabove and provide new and useful embodiments of a method of using a sound insulated device for quietly opening wrapped products. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Of course, various changes, modifications and alterations in the teachings of the present invention may be contemplated by those skilled in the art without departing from the intended spirit and scope thereof. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As such, it is intended that the present invention only be limited by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns that of a new and improved apparatus which incorporates an air ventilation system into a standard toilet seat. The present invention would connect a filtration system to the rear half portion of a toilet seat by a plurality of ventilation pathways. The plurality of ventilation pathways would connect to two primary ventilation pathways located in the rear of a toilet seat, which in turn would connect to the filtration system via a house connection. The filtration system itself would be housed in a box-like container, with the container having two major compartments, a filter compartment and a fan compartment. The filter compartment would be accessible by a user and would allow a user to place a replaceable filter. The fan compartment, separated from the filter compartment by a divider membrane, would include a fan motor, with the fan motor including a fan, belt, and an electric motor. The belt would hook up the fan to the electric motor and would ensure rotation of the fan once the electric motor would be activated. The present invention would be activated by a pressure-activated seat switch, with the switch being located on the underside of the rear half of the toilet seat. Once a user would sit down, the seat switch would complete an electrical circuit, allowing the present invention to operate. Alternatively, the present invention could be activated merely by a user turning on a light switch within a bathroom. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">V. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a side view of the present invention attached to toilet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be seen as it winds from toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and eventually connects up to filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is divided into two compartments, an upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, by divider membrane <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a front-mounted upper panel access door <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which allows access to upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to exchange filters as needed, and also has a front-mounted lower panel access door <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which allows access to lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Lower panel access door <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also has front-mounted exhaust port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> embedded on it. Lower panel access door <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allows access to the motor located within the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this diagram, seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can also be seen. Seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> could include a spring-loaded electric switch which is normally open. When a person sits upon the seat, the weight of the person would compress seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into a closed configuration. The electrical current then activates the fan motor, causing the motor of the present invention to engage and the present invention to operate. Alternatively, the electronic schematics of the present invention might be triggered by the light switch or the fan switch alone and not be triggered by any electronics associated with the seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a top view of toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of toilet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the present invention installed. Ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be seen connected to two ventilation pathways <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> located in the rear half of toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A plurality of small ventilation ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> allow air within the bowl to be sucked into the two ventilation pathways <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a side view of the filtration system of the present invention. Ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be seen entering the top of filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Within upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, replaceable filter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is located. In addition, divider membrane <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which divides upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with that of lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, has a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which serve as air passage ports between upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> I. Field of the Invention </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to lavatory or sink drain stoppers and, more particularly, to a secured drain stopper device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> II. Motivation for the Invention </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While modern technology has given us many advances and improvements in our lives, there are those advances which sometimes are a setback to what was previously used. An example of this is the common lavatory or sink drain. Years ago, the common way of holding water in a bowl with a drain was the rubber stopper. Advances in plumbing technology, metal and plastics led to the development and common use of the integral drain mechanism which used a lever to seal the drain from above the waterline. While this has generally worked, there are those instances where the integral drain commonly leaks water into the drain or leaks water on the floor through the lever attachment seal. Often replacement parts are no longer available for older drain mechanisms and the entire lavatory or sink must be replaced. Also, there are those users who may be looking for a retro lifestyle look and are unable to find it amongst current plumbing fixture offerings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there exists a need for a means by which the drain stopper mechanism of lavatories, sinks, tubs and the like can be replaced and/or repaired in a simple, straightforward manner. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Several patents disclose a pop-up lavatory plug or drain stopper: </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">IV. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a stopper-type apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use in the cylindrical drains of lavatories, kitchen sinks, utility tubs and the like is provided. The unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists of a round plastic plug or drain stopper <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, adapted to seat in a cylindrical drain, with a vinyl sealing ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> around its perimeter and a weighted lower or bottom portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. It is intended for use primarily in the drains of bathroom lavatories, but can be made in varying sizes for use in the drains of kitchen sinks, utility tubs, and other similar sinks. A chain <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fastened at its proximate end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to a chain securement means or bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> mounted to the center <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the upper surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of plastic plug <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to allow plug <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be extracted from the drain <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of a lavatory or sink basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> without placing one&apos;s hand in the water in basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> defined by waterline WL. This chain <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> would be secured to the faucet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at its other or distal or faucet securing end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by an integral ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> ARROWS A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depict the operational stages of insertion and sealing in drain <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>; and, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a sealed drain <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> partially filled with water to waterline WL. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> This invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is intended to be used in a manner similar to a rubber stopper, but would allow for better sealing. It is envisioned that the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would be supplied as new equipment on new sinks with integral drain mechanisms, or could be supplied through the do-it-yourself market as a replacement product for those sinks that have integral drain mechanism that do not seal or otherwise work properly. The use of the present invention allows for a continued use of older sinks with inoperable drain stopper mechanisms as well as providing an interesting means for holding water on newer sinks as well. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Because many varying and differing embodiments may be made within the scope of the inventive concept herein taught and because many modifications may be made in the embodiment herein detailed in accordance with the descriptive requirement of the law, it is to be understood that the details herein are to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, operation of the prior art automatic hair washer will be described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> First, in an initial operation, hot water and cold water is given to the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from an external water supply and an external hot water supply via a curb stop, a strainer, and a check valve. The hot water and the cold water is mixed in the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be warm water having a temperature suitable for hair washing, and supplied to the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the motor valve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The wash water stored in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is sucked by the hot water supplying pump <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and spouted from the shower heads SV<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to SV<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>through the hot water supply pipe A<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>via the hot water supplying electromagnetic valves <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>. After the wash water is spouted from the shower heads SV<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to SV<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>during a predetermined time, spouting of the wash water is stopped and the subsequent process, i.e., shampooing process is started. The shampoo agent pumped by the shampoo supplying pump <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is spouted from the nozzle heads <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>together with the wash water. When the shampooing process ends, the subsequent rinsing process and the process for washing with clean water follow, and then a series of washing processes ends. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In using the above-described prior art automatic hair washer, when wash water remains in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing, the wash water is drained. This is because before performing the next hair washing, the time may pass and the wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank may be cooled, whereby it may be impossible to use the wash water. Therefore, when large amount of wash water remains in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing, the large amount of wash water is in vain and it is quite uneconomical. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To solve the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide an automatic hair washer which does not drain wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing but uses the wash water in the next hair washing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description and specific embodiments described are provided only for illustration since various additions and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art from the detailed description. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, an automatic hair washer performing hair washing by supplying wash water in a hot water storing tank to washing nozzles comprises a temperature detecting means for measuring a temperature of the wash water in the hot water storing tank, a heater for heating the wash water in the hot water storing tank, and a heater control means for controlling the heater to operate and heat the wash water in the hot water storing tank to have a predetermined temperature when the wash water has a temperature below the predetermined temperature. Therefore, the wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing is not drained but used in the next hair washing after heated by the heater, thereby saving water. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, the automatic hair washer of the first aspect of the present invention comprises a water amount detecting means for detecting amount of the wash water in the hot water storing tank, and a heater control means for controlling the heater to operate and heat the wash water in the hot water storing tank to have a predetermined temperature when the wash water has a temperature below the predetermined temperature and the amount of the wash water in the hot water storing tank is more than a predetermined amount. Therefore, when the amount of the wash water in the hot water storing tank is small, the wash water is not heated by the heater, thereby avoiding heating an empty tank and saving electricity.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a construction of an automatic hair washer according to a first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the figure, the same reference numerals and characters as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> designate the same or corresponding parts. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> designates a heater for heating wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Numeral <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> designates a heater control unit for controlling the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with the temperature or water level of the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, operation of the automatic hair washer according to the first embodiment will be described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> First, in an initial operation, hot water and cold water is given to the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from an external water supply and an external hot water supply via a curb stop, a strainer, and a check valve. The hot water and the cold water is mixed in the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be warm water having a temperature suitable for hair washing and supplied to the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> until the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes full. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> monitors the temperature and water level of the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the thermistor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the float switch <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in process of hair washing. When the temperature of the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is below a set temperature and the water level thereof is over the lowest water level, the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> switches on the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to heat the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to have the set temperature. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a temperature below the set temperature and the water level is below the lowest water level, the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> does not start the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or, when the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is already working, switches off the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the water level of the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is below the lowest water level, when hair washing is to be continued thereafter, warm water is supplied from the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to replenish the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and when hair washing is to be ended, the wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is drained from the drainage electromagnetic valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, whereby there is no need for insulation by the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in either case. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are provided in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and when the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a temperature below the predetermined temperature, the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is started by the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, whereby the temperature of the wash water is set to the predetermined temperature. Therefore, even if the large amount of the wash water remains in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the end of hair washing, the wash water is not drained but can be used in the following hair washing, thereby saving water. In addition, when the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> detects that the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a temperature below the set temperature by the thermistor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and that the water level thereof is below the lowest water level by the float switch <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, heating of the wash water by the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not performed, thereby avoiding heating an empty tank and saving electricity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Temporary beds have been used for many years and come in many forms, from a simple futon or air mattress to more complex &ldquo;hide-a-bed&rdquo; style devices. Such temporary beds are most often used when guests, either expected or otherwise, stay overnight. In such cases, it is desirable that the temporary bed be quick and easy to assemble, comfortable, and collapse to a small configuration which can be easily and conveniently stored in a closet or storage cabinet. An air mattress has the advantage of deflating to a very compact size when the internal air pressure is released, and can be set up in a relatively short amount of time. The air pressure in the mattress gives good support to body members and the air can redistribute within the mattress slightly in response to greater weight loads in certain areas. It can thus conform to the user&apos;s body, is lightweight, and is generally easily portable, even when inflated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, air mattresses which are pitched on the floor of a dwelling, may be perceived as being less gracious than beds which are elevated from the floor. Elevated beds may have less intimate contact with floor dirt and grime, thus be more suitable for those with allergies or aversions to dirt. Furthermore, an elevated bed may be easier to get into and out of for those who may have trouble squatting on the floor, or for those with stiff joints or arthritis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Additionally, those who go camping out of trailers, etc. may wish to sleep out-of-doors, but may wish to isolate themselves from insects, snakes and other forest denizens which may roam the forest floor. For such purposes, an elevated bed, which is easily collapsible and portable, may be very useful. It also may be useful in rocky terrain, or in areas of thorns or burrs, which would otherwise contact the air mattress and possibly puncture it. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally, the less effort involved in constructing the bed, the more desirable the typical user would consider the bed to be. People who are contemplating retiring to bed are often already in a state of fatigue or unsteadiness in which the construction of a bed from a collapsed configuration to an expanded configuration may seem a daunting prospect. Therefore, a bed structure which requires minimal involvement by the user in its construction, or, even better, is largely self-erecting, would be very desirable in a variety of situations. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus there is a need for a collapsible bed which is elevated from contact with the ground or floor, and which is both very portable and comfortable for the user. There is also a need for a bed which requires minimal involvement by the user in its construction, or, even better, is largely self-erecting. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a bed that is collapsible and portable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a bed which stores in a very small space. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> And another object of the invention is to provide a bed which uses an air mattress which is elevated up off the floor. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a bed which requires a minimum of human effort to construct from a collapsed configuration to an expanded one. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An additional object of the invention is to provide a self-expanding bed in which the self-erecting mechanism is operated by remote control. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Briefly, one preferred embodiment of the present invention is a collapsible bed having an air mattress and a support frame. The frame includes a number of frame members, which are joined by pivot assemblies, such that the support frame as a whole expands outwardly from a central area, when a portion of the frame is pulled outwardly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A second preferred embodiment is a self-expanding bed having an air mattress and an articulated support frame. The frame includes a number of frame members, which are joined by pivot assemblies, such that the support frame as a whole expands outwardly from a central area. The air mattress is attached to the support frame at a number of points, so that when the air mattress is inflated and expands outwardly, the support frame also expands outwardly. An electric air pump may also be included, which may be activated by a remote control, so that the bed is self-expanding. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is that it uses an external frame and independent air mattress. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the invention is that the air mattress can be replaced if damaged, without replacing the whole bed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> And another advantage of the invention is that the frame is constructed with permanently joined members connected with pivot joints so that the frame collapses and expands as a unit, and requires very little construction or hunting for lost pieces. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An additional advantage of the invention is that it contains an air-pump which can be activated by a remote control to cause the pump to fill the mattress. The force of the air in the mattress as it expands causes the frame structure to expand and move from its collapsed to its expanded configuration, with minimal, or no manual effort by the user. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become clear to those skilled in the art in view of the description of the best presently known mode of carrying out the invention and the industrial applicability of the preferred embodiment as described herein and as illustrated in the several figures of the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention is an air bed with a support structure. As illustrated in the various drawings herein, and particularly in the view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> form of this preferred embodiment of the inventive device is depicted by the general reference character <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> illustrates an air bed with an elevated support structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, having generally an air bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which includes an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes generally a bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having an entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is sealed with a closure fastener <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is preferably a zipper <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, but which is also possibly any conventional device such as Velcro, hook-and-eye fasteners, etc. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be plastic, cloth, leather, etc. and encloses at least a portion of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is inserted into the entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, either before or after inflation. The zipper <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is then closed to complete the installation of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also be removed as desired through the same entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, again, either before or after the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is deflated. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a number of cells <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and at least one inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through which air is introduced to inflate the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> need not completely enclose the entire air mattress, but may enclose only a portion or portions such as the ends or sides of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the articulated support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which includes a number of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are attached to each other at pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, some of which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and some of which are included in pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect all the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. The frame can be thought of as an extended scissors-frame assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> since the tops and bottoms of each pair of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> scissor together or apart. These scissor pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are then joined in an extended assembly where the ends of multiple pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are joined at the pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. They also allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. Force directed at any one of the comers causes movement in all the other comers, so that there is movement of the whole frame in either an inward or outward direction, relative to a central area. The pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allow the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move towards a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from all sides as a unit when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be collapsed, and to move away from this central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when expanding. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> This configuration will be spoken of as &ldquo;expanding outwardly from a central area&rdquo;, although it is to be understood that one of the feet may actually remain in fixed position, while the remainder of the feet move outward. In other words, the central reference area from which the feet move, may itself move laterally. One example of this occurs when the collapsed support frame is placed in the corner of a room, where, say, the left rear foot of the frame is in the left rear corner of the room, and thus is constrained from movement in a further leftward or rearward direction. When the frame expands, all the other, non-constrained feet will expand outwardly from a central area to the right, or forward, or both, even as the central area itself will move to the right and forward, relative to the immobile left rear foot. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It should also be understood that all the lines of direction of the movement of the feet are not expected to intersect at a precise point. The central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is thus a relatively small region from which the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> move outwardly, but there should be no inference that all feet must move in a specific lines, such as radially from a single specific center point. To one skilled in the art, it will be apparent that if such precise directionality were attempted, manufacturing errors would inevitably introduce variations. Thus, the expansion is considered to move outwardly from a central area or region, and should not be construed to imply any particular lines of direction, other than generally outward from this central area. The direction arrows and central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and later in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference> below, are therefore not provided to show specific lines of movement which must be followed, but merely a general direction of movement towards, or away from, a general central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The articulated frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also optionally includes support webbing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which may have hooks (not shown) which anchor the support webbing to the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or the upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and may also have attachment points (not shown) for securing the fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the webbing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and thus to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> show closer views of the assembled air bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which several of the pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are selected for detail views in detail circles A-F. The pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in this embodiment are made to receive <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connections and thus will be called four-pivot connectors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. These are preferably reversible, so that the same four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be used as a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and as an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thus making for uniformity, and ease of manufacturing. The frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> too are preferably interchangeable and of uniform length, with the exception of the corner uprights <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which are positioned in each of the four comers. These are composed of two or more corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which may slide within each other in order to extend or contract in length. This is desirable because when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in collapsed position, the corner uprights <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> must be of greater length than when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is expanded. In the expanded position therefore, one of the corner members will preferably slide within the other, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and corner upright <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and its included corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are also shown. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle C of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle D of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, corner upright <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and its included corner member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are also shown. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle E of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, corner upright <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and its included corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle F of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are also shown. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, thus the assembly sequence allows for the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be placed upright, expanded, the fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inserted into the entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the fastener <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> closed, and the bed is ready to receive bed clothes, or be otherwise used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A useful variation on this invention is an air-bed with a self-expanding support structure. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> as element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The structure and elements are much the same, and when elements correspond to those used previously, the same element numbers will be used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The air-bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached to a support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, either directly, or preferably through a bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The attachment may be permanent or removable, by such conventional means as buttons, snaps, Velcro&reg;, etc., but it is important that the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as it expands, is attached at multiple points to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is urged to move with the expansion of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as discussed below. There is a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as described previously, which may also be the bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which protects the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from damage at points where it is rubbed against the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> while inflating or deflating. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> An air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is connected to an inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is electrically operated, and can be powered either by wall current or by batteries. If batteries are used, they may be included in a battery pack (not shown). The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably includes a sensor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which can be operated by a beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> or communicating means from a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> or communicating means is preferably cordless, such as radio or infra-red diode laser beam, etc. The remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably has an on-off button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which activates and deactivates the electric pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is by no means a necessity, and the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will preferably have a manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for back-up operation if the remote <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is misplaced or the remote&apos;s batteries are low, or if the bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is designed not to be operated by remote control at all. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In operation, the bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be assumed to start in a collapsed configuration <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is squeezed together and is generally surrounded by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> previously having been drawn together towards the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed above. The frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set upon its feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is activated, either by operation of a manual on-off switch, or by pressing the button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins filling the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which then begins to expand generally out from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as indicated by the direction arrows <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. As the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands it presses on the members of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which pushes them also in the direction away from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be optionally fitted with low friction pads which can thus slide across floor surfaces, or may also be fitted with wheels to allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to expand easily and without hindrance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be permanently attached to the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or it may be removable in order to allow access to the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by either a hand pump or by mouth in case electrical power is unavailable for the electrical pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, or if it breaks down. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an isometric view of an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which has been attached to the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a detail view of the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from which the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has been removed. Referring to both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>, the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a recess area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> into which the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been seated. This recess area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> allows the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to fit smoothly without extending far beyond the perimeter of the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thus protecting it from being bumped or knocked away from its position at the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be maintained in position after the inflation is complete. Of course, the use of a recess area is optional and should not be considered as a limitation. Also, the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be made to be routinely removed after operation. In this case a self-sealing valve (not shown) is provided for the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is also shown, which is preferably included even when the pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is expected to be operated by remote control. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Another optional feature is a secondary inflation port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which may be used for attachment of a manual air pump or for inflation by lung power. This may be a conventional air valve as generally used in air mattresses. It may also be used as a venting port <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for allowing air pressure out of the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> if the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is to be maintained in position, perhaps permanently. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of this invention uses an air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is removable. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably fitting with a friction lock (not visible) similar to those used to attach lens to cameras, and which forms an airtight seal between the two parts. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also preferably contains a pressure sensor or self-regulator (not visible) which detects or acts when the air pressure in the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has reached a predetermined level, and which then shuts off the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This is also not a required feature and should not be construed as a limitation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the electrical air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be operated from batteries, perhaps from a battery pack. The bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is thus usable in the outdoors or in a cabin which is not equipped with power lines. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> present an easy and attractive way of providing bedding for overnight guests or visitors. The articulated support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which includes a number of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are attached to each other at pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and at pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect all the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. They also allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. Force directed at any one of the corners causes movement in all the other corners, so that there is movement of the whole frame in either an inward or outward direction, relative to a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allow the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move towards a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from all sides as a unit when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be collapsed, and to move away from this central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when expanding. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In operation, the bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be assumed to start in a collapsed configuration <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is squeezed together and is generally surrounded by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> previously having been drawn together towards the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed above. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at multiple points, either directly, or by being at least partially enclosed by a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is, in turn, attached at multiple points to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set upon its feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and inflated, either by the user&apos;s lung power or by activation of an electric pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. If the preferred air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used, it is activated, either by operation of a manual on-off switch, or by pressing the button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins filling the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which then begins to expand generally out from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands it presses laterally on the members of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which pushes them also in the direction away from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be optionally fitted with low friction pads which can thus slide across floor surfaces, or may also be fitted with wheels to allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to expand easily and without hindrance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will find much application in user&apos;s homes, in commercial travel lodges, such as hotels, etc. where an extra bed may be needed, and may also find use in business offices to replace the occasional folding cot presently used by workaholics. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For the above, and other, reasons, it is expected that the air bed with elevated and self-expanding support structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention will have widespread industrial applicability. Therefore, it is expected that the commercial utility of the present invention will be extensive and long lasting. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an improvement for a protective helmet and more particularly for a helmet having at least two front protective shields that are moveable in rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background and Material Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Protective helmets have long been commonly used in different fields, whether professional, as is the case for military personnel, airplane or helicopter pilots, police officers or firemen, or civil or private use, as is the case for motorcycle users, rally or race car drivers, or construction workers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There is no lack of applications and numerous helmets are already known which have a rigid outer shell having a substantially spherical shape, equipped with an inner lining, and adapted to nest around the user&apos;s cranium while providing a facial opening for his face at the front. These helmets generally have an inner envelope of synthetic foam adapted to absorb shocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Certain helmets also have facial shields adapted to promote the protection of the user&apos;s face while allowing him to observe external events. Thus, helmets provided with an external visor and an internal ocular shield are found in prior art. However, these helmets have numerous disadvantages that are linked to their manufacture, use or cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Indeed, it is usually difficult to obtain journals of facial shields on the outer shell and the prior art devices do not satisfy entirely given their frailty, complexity and lack of comfort during use. In addition, since protective helmets are developed to adapt to different types of users, any increase in the number of sizes necessarily implies obtaining an equal number of sizes for most of the accessories and attachments, especially for different facial shields, thus increasing the development cost of these helmets. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, the object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned disadvantages by means that are simple, reliable, easy to implement and affordable. It has the objective of presenting a protective helmet having several facial shields, the journal configuration of the shields being simplified to allow easy manipulation thereof. This configuration also allows developing several different sizes of helmets while continuing to use a single shield size, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to its main feature, the protective helmet of the invention is of the type constituted by an outer shell adapted to protect the user&apos;s head and having at least two protective shields rotationally mobile with respect to the shell, and it is characterized in that a first shield is rotationally journalled on the shell, whereas a second shield is rotationally journalled on an intermediary connecting element attached to the shell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to an additional feature of the protective helmet, it is characterized in that the first shield is journalled about a pivot axis that is integral with the shell, and the second shield is journalled about a pivot axis that is integral with the connecting element, and in that these two pivot axes are co-axial and are borne by the same transverse axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the protective helmet of the invention, the main transverse axis bearing the journal axes is arranged in a zone located substantially at the upper end of the user&apos;s ear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative embodiment of the protective helmet of the invention, the rotational axes of the protective shields are not arranged in a co-axial manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the protective helmet, it is characterized in that the first shield journalled on the shell is a large sized facial shield adapted to at least partially occupy, when it is in a position of use, a facial opening presented by the helmet, and in that the second shield journalled on the connecting element is an ocular shield adapted to be positioned into a position of use in front of the user&apos;s eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to an additional feature of the protective helmet of the invention, the connecting element is constituted of two lateral walls connected together by a portion of a spherical cap and is attached to the helmet shell so as to be immoveable with respect thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the protective helmet, the latter is characterized in that the first shield is a facial shield assembled onto a shield support which extends it and which is journalled on the shell about a pivot axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the protective helmet of the invention, the shield support has two lateral walls, both of them having an attaching member for the facial shield and a pivot opening adapted to cooperate with the journal axis attached to the shell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to an additional feature of the protective helmet of the invention, the shield support has a pivot opening adapted to cooperate with a journal axis attached to the shell, and in that the opening and the axis have complementary indexing means adapted to index at least the two extreme positions of the facial shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the protective helmet, the latter is characterized in that it has a rigid shock absorbing cap that is maintained in position in the upper portion of the shell, due at least partially to the connecting element.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) equipped with protective shields according to the invention can be of any type, such as, for example, of the type used by firemen, military personnel or motorcyclists, or even bicyclists or skiers. It has a main outer shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) that protects the user&apos;s cranium and nape, and it has a front facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) in the zone occupied by the user&apos;s face. The helmet has a generally symmetrical longitudinal vertical plane (P). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) is of a rigid material and can be made of any appropriate material, such as plastic, steel, aluminum, or of a composite material of the type including a layering of reinforcement fibers that are impregnated and connected together by a resin matrix. According to the overall structure of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the outer shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), is constituted by a substantially spherical wall having several wall portions, namely, an upper front wall portion (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) extended rearwardly by an upper rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) which is itself extended downwardly by a lower rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and, in addition, it has two lateral wall portions: a right lateral wall portion (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and a left lateral wall portion (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The upper front portion (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) corresponds to the zone occupied by the user&apos;s forehead and is limited by the upper edge (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) of the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) which in turn is limited laterally by two lateral edges (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). The upper rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) corresponds to the zone occupied by the user&apos;s cranium, whereas the lower rear wall portion (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) corresponds to the zone occupied by the user&apos;s nape. Added to this is the fact that the wall of the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) is limited toward the bottom by a lower edge (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). The lateral wall portions (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) correspond to the zones occupied by the user&apos;s ears and are limited towards the front by the corresponding lateral edge (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) of the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and toward the bottom by the front ends of the lower edge (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) has at least two protective shields (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), both shields being rotationally mobile with respect to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) between two positions, namely, between an active lowered position of use (B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and an inactive raised position of non-use (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is journalled directly on the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), whereas the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is journalled on a connecting element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) integral with the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the invention, the helmet has a large sized facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) adapted to occupy the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) when it is in a position of use (B <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It also includes a smaller sized shield, called an ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), adapted to be positioned more specifically in front of the user&apos;s eyes when it is in a position of use (B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is constituted by a transparent wall made, for example, from plastic of the polycarbonate type or the like. This wall is essentially a spherical portion that is limited in order to be comprised between the two converging transverse planes (P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) forming a dihedral with an angle A open towards the front. The facial shield is constituted by a front wall (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) formed by a substantially spherical portion having a radius (R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) extended laterally towards the rear by two lateral arms (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) or ocular shield shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is constituted by a transparent wall made, for example, from plastic of the polycarbonate type or the like. This wall is essentially a spherical portion that is limited in order to be comprised between the two converging transverse planes (P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) forming a dihedral with an angle B open towards the front. The ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is constituted by a front wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) formed by a substantially spherical portion with a radius (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) extended laterally towards the rear by two lateral arms (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Added to this is the fact that the angle A formed by the two planes (P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is greater than the angle B formed by the two planes (P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), and that the radius (R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the spherical wall of the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is greater than the radius (R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the spherical wall of the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) or ocular shield is of a smaller size than the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) or facial shield. Thus, the front wall (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) has a height (H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) measured in the generally symmetrical plane (P), which is greater than the height (H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the front wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the second shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) measured under the same conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The first shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) or facial shield is journalled directly about a rotational axis (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) integral with the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), whereas the ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) is journalled about a rotational axis (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) integral with an intermediary connecting element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) attached to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the invention, the journal axes (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) of the two shields are advantageously arranged in each other&apos;s extension, i.e., they are borne by the same generally pivoting transverse axis (XX&prime;) that is substantially orthogonal to the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the helmet. It goes without saying that the two axes could be positioned in two separate locations so as to no longer be co-axial without leaving the scope of protection of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The intermediary element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is formed of two lateral walls (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) connected together by a portion of a spherical cap (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>). It is advantageously attached to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) at the lower end of its lateral walls so as to be immoveable with respect to the shell. The attachment of the connecting piece (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is done at two separate points of each of the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) near the lower edge (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) of the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) by means of two screws (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) adapted to cooperate with complementary housings (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>) located on the inner surface of the shell, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the invention, the journal of the ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and of the facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) is obtained co-axially in a zone located substantially at the level of the upper end of the user&apos;s ear. It is noted that in order to use the same type of facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) for the different shell sizes (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) itself is affixedly assembled to a shield support (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) which allows extending the facial shield and which is journalled on the pivot axis (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) arranged on the inner surface of the shell. Thus, to develop several helmet sizes, a facial shield of one size is used and is adapted to be installed on any helmet by means of a shield support (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) which allows adapting the shield to all sizes of shells (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) by lengthening the journal arms. This support element (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) is in the shape of an arc (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) that extends between two lateral wall portions (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), which each have an attaching member for the facial shield, such as affixing tabs arranged in a circular manner and projecting in toward the helmet to cooperate with an opening (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) located at the end of the facial shield itself, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. These wall portions (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the support (<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) also have, at their lower end, a journal opening (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) adapted to cooperate with the journal axis (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is noted that the shape of the opening (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) is not round but polygonal, thus allowing it to cooperate with complementary indexing means described hereinafter, which allow indexing the specific positions of the facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), such as the active position (B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and the raised position (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet, the indexing means and the journal axis are obtained from the same element (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) that is attached to the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) by means of a known screw system (<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) and housing for attachments (<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). This journal and indexing element (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) includes an assembly of ramps and projections adapted to index at least two extreme positions (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) due, in particular, to the elastic deformation of the lateral walls (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) that are distanced one from the other when their opening (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) and the ramps cooperate to allow pivoting between the two extreme indexed positions (A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the helmet (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the latter has a rigid shock absorbing cap (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) made of polyurethane foam, for example, and adapted to occupy the upper portion of the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). This car. (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) is advantageously maintained in position in the shell (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) due to the intermediary connecting element (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the helmet that is not shown, the journal axes of the two shields are no longer co-axial but occupy a separate position, the journal axis of the facial shield being arranged on the shell and that of the ocular shield being arranged on the intermediary connecting element in different positions. The facial shield is mounted on its support and thus allows extending the shield up to its journal axis, whereas the ocular shield is journalled about a journal axis of a traditional type which has no specific indexing means, but whose shield position can be blocked due to the friction between the axis and the shield while pivoting. It is noted that the ocular shield can also be provided with indexing means that are similar or dissimilar to those of the outer facial shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is also noted that the ocular shield (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) has a maneuvering handle (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) arranged on the lower edge of the ocular shield near the journal axis (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) which bears it and the facial opening (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) so as to allow the user to activate it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to correctly define the pivoting positions and to protect the indexing means which can be arranged on the two shields (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), it is noted that an abutment system which limits the pivoting of one or both shields downwardly and/or upwardly could also be provided. Added to this is the fact that the pivoting of one or both shields could be free or stopped, such as, for example, by friction at the level of its journal (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) or elsewhere in an appropriate zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> From the drawings, it is noted that the ocular shield and more specifically its front wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) has, during pivoting, a very short trajectory such that this shield is very close to the user&apos;s face, and especially to the eyes, just like ordinary glasses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In fact, a central cutout (<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>), open downwardly, is advantageously provided, and is adapted for the passage of the user&apos;s nose. Furthermore, a comfort and finishing joint can be provided on the lower edge of the shield. The facial shield (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) has, during its pivoting, a trajectory that is naturally farther apart which allows the shield to move forwardly beyond the zone occupied by the user&apos;s nose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the user could individually place either of the two in a lowered or raised position, or both shields at the same time, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, in particular. It is noted that the helmet advantageously has an inner cap (not shown) adapted for the user&apos;s comfort and correct positioning of the helmet. In the rear part of the helmet, this cap is advantageously attached directly to the attaching members arranged on the inner surface of the shell, whereas in the front part of the helmet, it is attached to the intermediary connecting element which bears the ocular shield and its journal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Of course, the invention is not limited to the embodiments described and represented by way of examples, and it also includes any technical equivalents as well as combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The instant application is based upon the French priority Patent Application No. 00 06822, filed May 29, 2000, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference thereto, and the priority of which is hereby claimed under 35 U.S.C. &sect;119. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to face guards for sporting helmets. More particularly, this invention relates to a face guard for football helmets manufactured using titanium wire and to a method for manufacturing such face guards. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional face guards or masks for protective helmets, such as football helmets, are typically manufactured using steel wire or steel tubing. Steel-based face guards desire improvement as they are relatively heavy and prone to corrosion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention advantageously relates to a face guard made of titanium wire having advantageous weight and corrosion-resistance characteristics as compared to steel-based face guards. The invention further relates to a method for producing face guards made of titanium wire in an manner that is uncomplicated and cost effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved face guard for protective helmets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a face guard of the character described for use with football helmets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that weighs less than conventional steel-based face guards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that is less prone to corrosion as compared to conventional steel-based face guards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that is made using titanium wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the invention is to provide a face guard of the character described that is economical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a method for producing face guards of the character described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> With regard to the foregoing and other objects, the present invention is directed to a method of making a face mask including the steps of providing a plurality of lengths of Grade 2, commercially pure titanium wire, having a diameter of from about 0.21 to about 0.24 inches; forming each length at room temperature using rotary bending apparatus to a desired bend angle by bending the member at room temperature to a first bend angle that is from about 1.25 to about 1.35 times greater than the desired bend angle; and welding each of the thus formed lengths to at least one other of the lengths in an ambient, oxygen containing environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention relates to a face mask including a plurality of wire members interconnected to one another. Each wire member includes a length of Grade 2, commercially pure titanium wire, having a diameter of from about 0.21 to about 0.24 inches. Each wire member is formed at room temperature using rotary bending apparatus to a desired bend angle by bending the member at room temperature to a first bend angle that is from about 1.25 to about 1.35 times greater than the desired bend angle. Each of the formed members is welded to at least one other of the members in an ambient, oxygen containing environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The invention advantageously enables manufacture of titanium face masks in a cost-effective and uncomplicated manner. Face masks in accordance with the invention are lighter in weight than conventional steel-based face masks and offer numerous advantages to conventional face masks.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the foregoing lengths are for a preferred embodiment only and that the wires may be of various other lengths depending on the desired configuration and size of the mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The members are next formed, preferably at room temperature (e.g., about 50 to about 80&deg; F.), to impart a desired shape to each of the wires <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the desired configuration preferably being that shown for the members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In this regard, and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is preferably formed into member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by first bending the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as by rotary bending using a die of desired dimension to achieve a desired formed resented by the angle A, of about 159 degrees and a center-line radius (CL) of about 4.34 inches. The formed wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is substantially symmetrical and bilateral, as shown in the top plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As will be noted, ends <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are substantially outside of the bend imparted as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The ends <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are preferably about 2 inches in length and are formed as explained below using press brake bending equipment to achieve the final configuration of the member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Returning to the initial manipulation of the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to achieve the desired formed degree of bend, it has been experienced that a formed degree of bend of 159 degrees for the member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be achieved using a die having a radius of about 3.195 inches and overbending the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a degree of bend A&prime;, shown in phantom, of about 206 degrees. Thus, the wire <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> must be significantly bent past the desired formed degree of bend to impart the desired bend. The foregoing described bend and the similar bends described below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are preferably made using rotary bending apparatus and at room temperature.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is surprising that welds of suitable strength to achieve a face mask compliant with the relevant standards of the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) such as the NOCSAE Standard Method of Impact and Performance Requirements for Football Faceguards were achievable. It is known that titanium is highly reactive and would not be expected to provide suitable weld strength when welded in a reactive environment, such as in the presence of oxygen. As will be appreciated, the ability to achieve suitable weld strength in this manner achieves considerable cost savings as compared to welding in a non-reactive environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of the invention, it was observed that the settings set forth in Table 3 were important to achieving suitable weld strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> After welding, the guard is removed from the fixture and all wire terminations ground using silicon carbide sandpaper to a full radius to avoid sharp ends. The face guard is thereafter cleaned, primed with a bonding agent, such as a lacquer basic phenolic bonding agent, and coated with vinyl to a thickness of from about 0.02 to about 0.09 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When used for football helmets, face guards in accordance with the invention should be tested for compliance with the afore-mentioned NOCSAE standard. Likewise, compliance with any other relevant standards or criteria should be determined dependent upon the intended use of the face guard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A face guard constructed as described herein was observed to have a weight less than that of conventional steel wire and steel tubing face guards. For example, a similarly configured face guard made from steel wire of the same diameter (0.225 inches) would have a weight of over about 16 ounces, uncoated, and one made from steel tubing having an outside diameter of about 0.25 inches (i.d. 0.160 inches) would have a weight of at least about 11 ounces, uncoated. The foregoing described face guard of the invention has a weight of about 9 ounces, uncoated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It has also been observed that face guards made in accordance with the invention are more resistant to corrosion than conventional steel and steel tubing face guards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The invention advances the art by enabling the production of face guards made of titanium wire which have desirable qualities and which may be produced in an economical and uncomplicated manner. It has been stated in the prior art that face guards could be made using titanium containing materials. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,713,082 states that the face mask thereof &ldquo;is usually cast with thin cross sections as a single piece and hardened using high strength alloys (e.g. titanium, 4140 steel, 4140 stainless steel, etc.).&rdquo; Col. 5, lines 2-4. U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,088 describes a face guard of metal tubes construction, with a metal tube <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> thereof made of steel, or of other metals or metal alloys (metal mixtures) such as aluminum, carbon, cobalt, chromium, iron, nickel, tin titanium and zinc. Co, 4, lines 7-1 1. It is believed that prior attempts to manufacture face guards using titanium containing materials have resulted in face guards that are unsuitable for their intended purpose and/or of such expense so at to be commercially unfeasible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It has unexpectedly been discovered that face guards of desirable characteristics may be economically produced in accordance with the invention. For example, in accordance with the invention, it has been discovered that face guards having desirable characteristics may be manufactured using Grade 2, commercially pure titanium wire, having a diameter of from about 0.21 to about 0.24 inches, most preferably from about 0.224 to about 0.225 inches. For the purposes of the invention, it was observed that the selection of this particular material in the afore-mentioned diameter range was important to achieving the purposes of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention has been provided for purposes of illustration only, and it is understood that numerous modifications or alterations may be made in and to the illustrated embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to gloves for the human hand which are worn when playing sports such as baseball, softball, and the like. More particularly, this invention relates to a batting glove specifically designed to improve grip, comfort, protection, and performance of a wearer. However, this invention has broader implications and may be advantageously employed in other applications requiring protection of the hands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Glove construction for protection of the human hand is well known. In addition, there are a number of patents which teach gloves claimed to be particularly useful as batting gloves. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,175,226 teaches a dress glove construction which completely covers the fingers and which includes resiliently expandable materials in selected areas to accommodate hands of different sizes. In contrast, U.S. Pat. No. 4,561,122 teaches a protective glove which has a wrap around construction for a protective glove which leaves the thumb and fingers ends exposed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,345,609 teaches a protective glove which includes shock absorbing cells disposed at selected portions along the top of the glove. U.S. Pat. No. 5,790,980 teaches a hand glove with a polyurethane foam pad in the palm portion of the glove. Other references attempt to provide a sport glove for supporting and stabilizing the wrist and hand. Current gloves protect the bony prominence areas of the hand. Although hand protection from direct shocks and abrasions is found in gloves of the current art, what is needed is a batting glove which provides improved grip, comfort and performance by unloading bony prominences, unloading pulleys and tendons, and improving finger and knuckle motion of the hand of a wearer by providing preselected thicknesses of preselected materials specifically chosen to protect the wearer from injury from distributed shocks in hitting a ball with a bat, and the attendant risk of long-term injury to the aforementioned bones, ligaments, pulleys, tendons, etc., by repetitive swinging of bats and hitting of balls. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a batting glove which takes stress off of selected parts of the human hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a batting glove having preselected materials of construction in different areas of contact with the human hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a batting glove having preselected thicknesses of preselected materials of construction in different areas of contact with the human hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a batting glove which uses different materials to allow wrist motion, unload bony prominences, improve finger and knuckle motion, and protect the back of the hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the present invention provides a batting glove including preselected material in preselected thicknesses to fill in the soft spots surrounding the bony prominences of the hand, to unload the pulleys and tendons, and to take stress off of selected parts of the hand. Specifically, 2-Way SPANDEX&reg; materials are used in the wrist motion zone of the glove; thin elastic material such as LYCRA&reg; is used in the area of the finger joints and knuckles; synthetic material such as JANEC SUPER&reg; is used in the area of the dorsal side of the fingers; a cabretta skin protective covering is used for selected parts of the hand, rubber foam protective padding is placed at selected contact areas, and soft padding such as terry cotton is placed inside the glove in selected areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further objects and advantages of this invention will appear from the following description and appended claims, reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part of the specification wherein like reference characters designate corresponding parts into several views.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows the skeletal anatomy, pulley system, and flexor tendons of the thumb <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and fingers <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the right hand <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The thumb <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> includes the flexor tendon (flexor pollicis longus) <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the three pulleys <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the thumb <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>; an A1 pulley <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, A2 pulley <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and A3 pulley <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The A2 pulley <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is the most important for function and is attached to the proximal phalanx <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the thumb <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The respective pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> are also shown for each of the: index finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, long finger <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, ring finger <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, and small finger <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has five pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>; an A1 pulley <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, A3 pulley <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, and A5 pulley <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. The A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are considered to be the most important for function. The A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is attached to the proximal phalanx <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is attached to the middle phalanx <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The A1 pulley <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is near the MCP joint <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the A3 pulley <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is near the PIP joint <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the A5 pulley <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is near the DIP joint <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The flexor tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are shown as one unit for each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, but actually there are two flexor tendons to each unit. They are the flexor digitorum superficialis and the flexor digitorum profundus (shown as one, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). These tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> travel underneath the pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and attach to the distal phalanx <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> move back and forth below the pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, via muscles (not shown) attached to the proximal end of the tendons. This movement of the tendon <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> produces finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> flexion. The pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> prevent the flexor tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> from bowstringing or moving away from the bone with finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> flexion. If the pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> are damaged and no longer function, the tendons <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> will bowstring with a resultant significant loss of finger motion as well as grip strength. As such, pulleys <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, especially the A2 pulley <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and the A4 pulley <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, are very important and must be preserved and protected as much as possible. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, protective padding <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for each finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is placed in an anatomically designed fashion over the A2 and A4 pulley regions. When the A2 and A4 pulleys <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are preserved, adequate finger <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> motion and grip strength is maintained. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an adjustable, disposable garment protector useful to protect the garments of a user from spills, dropped food and the like during the consumption of food and beverages, particularly fast food beverages. The invention also relates to a convertible food bag and a method for packaging the disposable garment protector and a method for disposing of the disposable garment protector and its contents after use. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE MENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Garment protectors have been used to protect the front of infants during feeding or dining and diners eating particularly messy foods such as lobsters and the like for many years. However, most such garment protectors simply consist of a cloth-like garment protector supported at the back of the neck of a user and do nothing to catch liquids or foods which may be spilled on the garment protector and pass downwardly over the surface of the garment protector and onto the garments of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Such garment protectors do not serve the needs of modern consumers who frequently purchase food at fast food drive-ins or drive-throughs for consumption in an automotive vehicle while moving on crowded roadways and the like. Garment protectors for such use should not only be easily disposable but they should also provide a means for containing any waste materials spilled and provide for a method of disposing of both any spilled food particles, liquids and the like as well as the garment protector itself after the user has finished dining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a continuing search has been directed to the development of a disposable garment protector which protects the garments of a user while dining in automobiles, school cafeterias, offices, picnicking, or like activities and provides for the disposal of any spilled or dropped food particles, liquids or packaging and for the disposal of the garment protector itself. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, an adjustable disposable garment protector is provided and comprises a protector support adapted to support the garment protector from the neck of a user; a protector cover having a front surface and a back surface, a first side and a second side, a first and a second end and supported at its first end by the protector support in a position covering a front portion of the chest and stomach of the user; and, a pouch positioned on the second end of the protector cover, the pouch having a top end and a bottom end, a front and a back and being formed to fold to one of a first closed position for storage and a second opened position having its top end opened and positioned to collect particulates and liquids moving downwardly along the front surface of the garment protector in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The garment protector may also be fabricated as a convertible food bag which is convertible into an adjustable disposable garment protector, the convertible food bag comprising a food bag having a front and a back, a first side and a second side, a top and a bottom, a disposable garment protector support adapted to support the disposable garment protector from the neck of a user, a pouch formed by a lower portion of the bag and having a top and a bottom end, a front and a back and being formed to fold to one of a closed position for storage and a second opened position having its top end open and a tearable perforation or a cut across the front, first side and second side of the bag so that the bag above the top of the pouch is foldable to a closed position to form a protector cover having a front surface and a back surface, a first side and a second side, a first and a second end and supported at its first end by the protector support in a position covering a front portion of the chest and stomach of the user.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an alternate embodiment of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown. The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is basically a slipover design where support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> constitutes a single strap which may be adjusted by creases and adhesives. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> two straps are shown. The straps are joined to a first side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a second side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of a first end <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (top) of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and are overlapped with an end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of a first strap and an end <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of a second strap. The straps can be joined by VELCRO, adhesives or as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> by a snap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or the like. In both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> perforations <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are shown. A variety of fasteners can be used such as VELCRO, adhesives, snaps, buttons, tying, the use of a continuous strap with a slipover fit and the like. Such variations are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> plurality of perforations <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are shown in each side of a strap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A single perforation could be used, and two straps could be used but for convenience a plurality of perforations is shown in a slip-over strap. In this embodiment, strap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be shortened by tearing one of the perforations on each side and moving the end (strap tear end) of the strap removed at the perforation to engage a adhesive shown at <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. By selection of the desired perforation, strap <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be shortened to any desired length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In other respects, the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is similar to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> food bag convertible to become a disposable garment protector is shown. The food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has a top <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and a front <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and first and second sides <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>respectively. A support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as discussed in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is positioned to extend above back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, during use of the bag, support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is bent downwardly along the back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. In this configuration the bag is readily used to serve food and the like. Bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Further bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a cut <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or a perforation which is easily tearable along front <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and sides <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of food bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, but strong enough to permit use of the bag as a container. This permits the bag sections above top <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to be separated and folded back against front <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A clip or tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> made of a suitable deformable material such as treated paper or the like is positioned on the top of back <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and is used as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> for deformation to hold the collapsed upper sections of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in a collapsed position against front <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be of the same material as bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and may be insertable into a slot <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; inside <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>A of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for mating engagement with tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, to hold the collapsed upper sections of bag <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in a collapsed position. In this configuration, the bag is readily used as a disposable garment protector. The bag may also be fabricated from a clear plastic or the like so that the contents of the bag can be seen by the purchaser. Bags of this type are also suitable for conversion to a garment protector as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12 a</cross-reference> cross-section of the back <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of protector cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shown. A front layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> comprises a soft, absorbent material such as a towel or napkin-like material which has suitable strength to form support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A backing <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is positioned by bonding it to the back of the front layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. This configuration permits the bag to be fabricated economically by placing the water repellant material only on the lower portion of the disposable garment protector where it is needed rather than behind the front of the entire disposable garment protector. Of course, no such backing is required when a plastic bag is used. Such fabricaton techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Various adhesives have been referred to in the discussion of the present invention. These adhesives are adhesive strips which are preferably covered with a peelable or otherwise readily removable covering so that the adhesive is not activated until it is desired by the user to do so. Such adhesives are readily available and form no part of the present invention except as they may function in conjunction with other components of the collapsible garment protector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, an adhesive strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is shown near the top of support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This strip is used to retain the disposable garment protector in a rolled-up position when the user has finished with it. When the user has finished his meal, an adhesive strip <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is used to close pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The pouch then contains any spilled or discarded materials or the like which have been placed in pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can also be used for the disposal of napkins, empty packages and the like consistent with the size of pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. After pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has been closed, the garment protector may be rolled into a tight roll and retained in the tight roll by use of adhesive strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This permits the economical use of space in a vehicle with the waste materials from the meal contained in the disposable garment protector. Similarly tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> may be formed as an adhesive tab and used in a similar fashion or an adhesive tab may be used in lieu of tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> By the use of the present invention, a user may safely purchase and consume fast food products while occupying a vehicle or the like without risk of soiling the users&apos; garments. After the disposable garment protector has been used, it can then be utilized to store spills and other refuse from the consumed meal in a fashion consistent with the maintenance of neatness in the vehicle and the like until an opportunity to dispose of the disposable garment protector is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The disposable garment protectors may be stored in flat containers from which they are removed sequentially by use of a tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The tab in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is adapted to be grasped by a user of the disposable garment protector, or a third party dispersing the disposal garment protector to a user, for the removal of a disposable garment protector from a storage box, drawer or the like in which the disposable garment protectors are positioned as flat stackable disposable garment protectors. Alternatively, the disposable garment protector may be folded at lines such as line <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and at perforations <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> if folded with pouch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> facing downwardly along line <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> with support <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being folded upwardly and over the remaining portions of disposable garment protector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at perforation <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&prime;. The disposable garment protectors may be placed in a smaller container and again may be removed by grasping tab <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which may comprise a covered adhesive tab. This permits the storage of disposable garment protectors in a smaller container which may be somewhat taller but occupies a smaller horizontal space than when the disposable garment protectors are stacked in the flattened form. Many variations in the packaging of disposable products, such as the adjustable disposable garment protectors, are possible and well-known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Having thus described the present invention by reference to certain of its preferred embodiments, it is pointed out that many variations and modifications are possible within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is broadly concerned with therapy apparel for children diagnosed with sensory integration dysfunction and/or impaired motor development. The apparel is designed to be worn during the course of a therapy session, and has been found to yield many benefits to children under such treatment. The preferred therapy apparel includes a top worn over the shoulders and trunk of a child with a series of flexible, stretchable elastic straps designed for selective placement around the child&apos;s feet and knees during different therapy exercises, and for grasping and lateral extension by the child. The top is adorned with fanciful theme decorations thereon to arouse the child&apos;s interest and fulfill play needs. The overall apparel further includes a cape and specialized, close-fitting headgear, which again are appropriately theme-decorated. The headgear is designed to permit the child to attach various fanciful accouterments to excite the child and enhance motor skill development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Sensory integrative dysfunction is a developmental disorder defined by deficits in the central processing of proprioceptive, tactile, and vestibular sensory inputs that are not attributable to either peripheral or cortical central nervous system dysfunction. The proprioceptive sense refers to components of muscles, joints, and tendons that provide a person with a subconscious awareness of body position and movement. Children with sensory integration dysfunction may have difficulty maintaining balance in relation to environmental demands and have difficulty with tasks that require opposing muscle groups to work in a coordinated fashion, such as wringing out a wash cloth or pouring milk from a heavy container. The tactile sense interprets applied stimuli such as touch, pressure, pain, and temperature, through tactile receptors found throughout the skin. Some children are overly sensitive to touch, particularly light touch and have a tendency to react negatively and with extreme emotion to some tactile sensations. On the other hand, some children crave tactile input, touching and seeking out input. The vestibular sense is responsible for awareness of body position and movement in space, postural tone and equilibrium, and stabilization of the eyes in space during head movements. The vestibular receptors are located in the inner ear and are stimulated by movement of the head and by gravity. Children with sensory integration dysfunction may have balance difficulties and cannot tolerate or interpret movement, while others seem to crave movement opportunities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Sensory integration theory postulates that intervention through therapy provides enhanced sensory experience within the context of a meaningful, self-directed activity in order to elicit an adaptive behavior. The result is enhanced sensory integration and, in turn, enhanced learning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One method of proprioceptive and tactile sensory stimulation is deep pressure or deep touch pressure. Deep touch pressure is the type of surface pressure that is exerted in most types of firm touching, holding, and stroking. One investigator observed this need for deep pressure from a girl with autism as she would hug her mother with strong, firm hugs. Her mother indicated that her child favored clothing that covered her limbs and was made from cotton knit fabric. Her mother would often dress the child in a jumper or skirt over cotton knit, flowered longjohns. The need to cover the limbs with fabric that hugs the body is characteristic of the child who needs continuous tactile input. In contrast, a four-year-old male with autism was observed who did not like clothing. He would remove his shirt, socks, and shoes, and pull his pant legs up as far as possible. These are characteristic of tactile defensiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Weighted vests, weighted collars, weighted arms and leg bands, lap and shoulder weights, and weighted quilts are available for treating deep pressure needs. One investigator conducted a pilot study applying weighted vests with two samples, children with autism and children without autism. The non-autistic children reported that wearing the vest made them feel sleepy, but showed no appreciable change in pulse or blood pressure; whereas, the children with autism had measurable drops in both pulse rate and blood pressure reading. While the wearing of weighted vests are increasing in elementary schools and therapy treatment programs, the outcomes of wearing weighted vests are largely anecdotal and few parameters exist to guide the use of the vests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Gloves and pressure vests have been shown to reduce self-stimulatory behaviors of a young girl with autism. Similarly, self-injurious and self-stimulating behaviors of a boy with autism were reduced while wearing arm splints and elastic bandages. A calming effect provided by the direct pressure has been reported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An adult with autism has reported that deep pressure applied to her body provides a calming effect. A squeeze machine was designed to provide great amounts of pressure over her body. The squeeze machine&apos;s pressure also had a relaxing effect on adults without disability. Use of the squeeze machine also led to a reduction in hyperactivity in four of nine children. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The foregoing indicates that deep pressure and tactile input is calming for children with sensory impairments and that apparel and textile products may be used as therapeutic aids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing expedients have been used in the past in an attempt to provide appropriate therapy for children diagnosed with sensory integration dysfunction, the prior apparel and the like has not fulfilled the play and imaginative needs of small children; moreover, the prior therapy garments do not generally provide the full range of desirable therapy inputs for the treatment of sensory integration dysfunctions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the problems outlined above and provides therapy apparel for small children diagnosed with sensory integration dysfunction and impaired motor development. Broadly speaking, the therapy apparel includes a flexible top adapted to be worn over the shoulders and trunk of a child requiring therapy, with the top having upper shoulder sections and a neck opening therebetween, and front and rear panels depending from the shoulder sections and presenting lower margins. The top includes a pair of flexible, stretchable first straps extending below the panel lower margins with each first strap being of a length for selective coupling with a respective one of the child&apos;s feet while the child is standing. In this orientation, the first straps cause the top and straps to be pulled downwardly to provide deep pressure therapy input. Preferably, each of the first straps is in the form of a continuous loop passing adjacent a shoulder section of the top and with the lower end of each loop adapted for passing under a respective foot of the child; in this way, upwardly directed forces are generated to give upward pressure and proprioceptive input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In further preferred forms, the top has a pair of flexible, stretchable second straps likewise extending below the lower margin of the top with each second strap being of a length for selective coupling with a respective one of the child&apos;s knees when the child is in a tall kneeling position; these second straps are also configured to cause the top strap to be pulled downwardly in this orientation. The second straps are likewise in the form of continues loops which pass adjacent a shoulder section and with the lower end of the loops adapted for coupling with the child&apos;s knees, to generated upwardly forces. Finally, the top also includes a third pair of flexible, stretchable, loop-type lateral straps each selectively extensible in opposed lateral directions beyond the side sections of the top and grasped by the child. These lateral straps when extended cause the top to be pulled in corresponding lateral directions, creating resistance against the child&apos;s hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder joints and coordinating muscles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The front and rear panels of the top are preferably provided with fanciful theme decorations thereon, such as insects (e.g. beetles), aquatic animals with fins, scales and eyes, animals having horns, ears, noses, eyes and tails, royalty with crowns, and wands, workers such as firemen, policemen, mail carriers, construction workers and cowboys, and shapes, colors and textures of various types (squares, circles, triangles, ovals and the like). Furthermore, in order to provide a further measure of deep pressure input, the front and back panels of the top are provided with pockets which receive weights of various sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The preferred apparel also includes a cape to be worn over the top with the cape having a neckpiece and a pair of opposed, outwardly extending wing sections, the latter each having a handhold. The outer surface of the cape is equipped with differently manipulable objects which can be grasped and used by the child, in order to provide fine motor development. The outer surface of the cape is also preferably decorated in a manner corresponding to the decorations provided on the apparel top </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Finally, the therapy apparel includes headgear which is stretchable and equipped with a chin strap so that the headgear may be drawn tightly around the child&apos;s head. The headgear further has a plurality of different, fanciful accouterments each attachable to the exterior surface of the headgear at the discretion of the child. For this purpose, a headgear preferably has a central panel and opposed side panels, with stretchable fabric interconnecting the panels; the outer surface of the panels, and the corresponding ends of the accouterments, have mating hook and loop Velcro&reg; fabric sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The therapy apparel of the invention allows full body movement by the child to facilitate participation in all occupational activities and use of occupational/physical therapy equipment. Moreover, the apparel provides opportunities for active proprioceptive input, allows for passive and deep pressure proprioceptive input, promotes use of equipment to provide vestibular input and generates desirable tactile input. Use of the therapy apparel promotes gross, fine and perceptual motor skills along with motor planning up to three stages, and enhances transitions without behavior resistance from the child between activities, thus aiding in the wearer&apos;s self-organization and attention to task. Finally, the apparel meets the play needs of the child, with structures and forms revolving around play themes favored by children.</paragraph>

Broadly speaking, the apparel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a sleeveless fabric top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be worn over the shoulders and trunk of the child <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a fabric cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a flexible, close-fitting headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) includes a pair of upper padded raglan shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a neckhole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> therebetween, and a pair of depending front and rear panels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> depending from the shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A pair of large arm holes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed below the shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, with respective side sections <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> below the corresponding arm holes. The panels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the side sections <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> form a continuous lower margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The entire top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is constructed to have a lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed of appropriately sewn-together fabric (e.g., cotton spandex knit), an interlining to internally organize the straps (polyester knit interfacing), as well as a fabric exterior <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is likewise sewn-together. The fabric exterior <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed using any desired fabric such as gold spandex, and is adorned with fanciful theme decorations, such as a &ldquo;beetle&rdquo; design on the front and rear panels. In addition, a series of openings are provided in the fabric <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for receipt of stretchable straps which extend between the outer fabric exterior <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In particular, lower slit openings <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are provided in the front and rear panels adjacent margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, along with upper slit openings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of each shoulder section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Elongated lateral slits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are provided on the front and rear panels adjacent the armholes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Finally, somewhat shorter lateral slits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are formed in the side sections <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> accommodate a total of three pairs of elongated, continuous-loop stretchable straps formed of elastic, which extend through corresponding channels in the top which are interlined with polyester knit interfacing. Specifically, a first pair of leg straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extend through the slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, so that the upper ends of the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> overly the corresponding shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and extend below margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, each of the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a short, flexible elastic segment <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> adjacent the lower end thereof, defining corresponding foot-receiving openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A second set of somewhat shorter knee straps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are threaded through the slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> but lie within the confines of the longer leg straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> have a hanging length of about 27 &frac12; inches when relaxed, whereas the knee straps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> have a relaxed hanging length of about 20&frac12; inches. A hold-down strap <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is secured at the lower margin side in order to hold straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> when not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A pair of upper and lower lateral continuous loop straps <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are also supported by the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and in the illustrated embodiment have a relaxed length of 23 inches. As illustrated, the upper strap <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extends through the arcuate slits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, whereas the lower strap <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> passes through the slits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A hold down strap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is secured to the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at the lower sections of armholes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in order to hold straps <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in place when not in use. The hold down straps <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are selectively releasable via hook and loop (Velcro&reg;) material respectively secured to the inner surface of the straps <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the outer fabric of the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the interlining <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> includes pieces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>preferably formed of polyester knit interfacing which are attached to lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The upright pieces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extend from the shoulder regions downwardly towards margin <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and are sewn with stitching <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to define corresponding open-ended strap channels <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which receive the straps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (straps <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The piece <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>overlies the pieces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and is attached by stitching <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> defining upper and lower open-ended, lateral channels <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which respectively receive straps <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Although not illustrated, it will be appreciated that the rear panel of the lining <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is also equipped with interlining as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, so that the loop straps <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are supported front and rear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Each of the front and rear panels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is equipped with a pair of side-by side open top pockets <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> which are designed to receive weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Such weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably correspond with the fanciful theme of the surface decoration of the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For example, in the case of the &ldquo;beetle&rdquo; theme, the weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> would be in the form of baby bugs having a surface decoration including fabric &ldquo;wings&rdquo; as well as extensible &ldquo;feelers&rdquo; (not shown). The weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be provided in different sizes (e.g. &frac14; and &frac12; pound) are preferably formed of fabric and are filled with metal pellets or other weighting material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The overall apparel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a fabric cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having an exterior fabric surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and an inner lining surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Again, the exterior surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is advantageously consistent in its design with the fanciful theme of top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, this exterior surface would have a similar &ldquo;beetle&rdquo; design along the central portion of the cape outer surface. In more detail, the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a central neckpiece <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> made up of a pair of selectively interconnectable straps <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> provided with matable hook and loop fabric pieces <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In addition, the cape has a central section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> as well as outwardly extending wing sections <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The inner surface <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the cape has a pair of hand holds <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> on the wing sections <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which can be grasped by the child to extend the cape, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The inner lining of the cape has a pair of Velcro&reg; straps designed to mate with corresponding Velcro&reg; straps <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> provided on the shoulder sections <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The outer fabric surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is also provided with differently manipulable objects which can be manipulated and used by the child. Specifically, the central section <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> has a zippered pocket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> as well as an adjacent button-closed pocket <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The wing section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a lacing assembly <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> made up of a pair of elongated fabric sections <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> provided with eyelets <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>; a lacing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is threaded through the eyelets <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and conventionally knotted. The wing section <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the other hand has a zipper assembly <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> made up of a pair of fabric sections <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> interconnected by an elongated separating zipper <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is designed as a close-fitting head covering and includes a pair of padded side panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a padded central panel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are formed of padded fabric with the exterior surfaces thereof formed of Velcro&reg; loop material. A pair of elongated, stretchable elastic sections <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> interconnect the central panel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and side panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, so as to allow a stretch fit on the head of a child. A chin strap <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a mating Velcro&reg; outer end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extends between the side panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and allows the headgear to be drawn tightly around the child&apos;s head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is also provided with a plurality of different, fanciful accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> each having a base <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> formed of mating Velcro&reg; fabric, allowing the respective accouterments to be attached to any desired point on the panels <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, at the discretion of the child. The accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be of virtually any appropriate configuration, consistent with the fanciful decorations on the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, it will be seen that the accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> include wings <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, eyes <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, antennae <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of various sizes and configurations, and small weighted bugs <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In use, the therapy apparel is donned by the child, with assistance from the therapist. First, the top <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is put on, with the therapist selecting appropriate weights <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for insertion into the pockets <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Thereupon, the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are donned, with the chin strap of the latter being drawn to ensure that the headgear is in close fitting relationship to the child&apos;s head. The child is then encouraged to decorate the headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> at the child&apos;s discretion. This is of course readily accomplished owing to the construction of the accouterments having bases <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which are attachable to the outer surface of the headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides low level protection and sensory input and integration (tactile, proprioceptive and vestibular). The opportunity to decorate the headgear <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with accouterments <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> gives motor development opportunities, appeals to the play needs of the child and enhances the opportunity for social interaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Actual observations of children wearing the therapy apparel of the invention demonstrates that the garments enable children to function at a higher attention level and skill level during therapy. One subject had difficulty managing his behavior, organizing himself and staying on task. When wearing the apparel, there was a noticeable improvement in the subject&apos;s behavior, which is believed to have occurred because the elastic straps and/or weights provided the correct amount of arousal, modulation and discrimination, all leading to skill output. Another major benefit was that use of the Bootstraps <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> notably decreased the subject&apos;s toe walking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The fanciful design on the apparel promoted the use of vestibular integrating suspended equipment. Several subjects pretended they were &ldquo;flying&rdquo; and used suspended swings as flying vehicles. The duration of time the subjects spent in the suspended equipment increased with continued wearing of the therapy apparel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A variety of tactile opportunities were provided by the various different fabrics and other different materials used in the construction of the apparel. As the children interacted with the apparel they received tactile input from the elastic straps, hugging the cape <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to their bodies, throwing the bug weights, placing items in the top and cape pockets, and manipulating the cape&apos;s zippers, button and lacing assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Fine and perceptual motor skill activity in the subjects increased by interaction with the cape&apos;s fastening system and the zippers, button, button hole, Velcro&reg; sections and lacing. Resistance-free transitions were observed between gross motor and fine motor activities and motor planning was promoted by using the cape to store fine motor activities. The subjects planned activities retrieved the objects for the activities, stored objects in the cape&apos;s pockets, participated in gross motor activity and then removed the objects from the cape&apos;s pockets for fine motor activity. Using the top and cape pockets promoted smooth transitions and organization of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The play needs of the wearers were satisfied with the &ldquo;bug superhero&rdquo; theme, and the apparel stimulated the desire to engage in imaginative play while also allowing the therapist to incorporate therapy goal activities. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a Martial Arts Gi or practice uniform having highly visible patches or targets which will lie superimposed over the most vital points of contact on the body of the wearer. The combatants, during practice, may then accurately aim non-contact kicks and punches at these most vital points on their opponent&apos;s body so as to practice rendering their opponent incapacitated in the most efficient manner. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In many of the martial arts, for example, jiu jitsu, karate, etc., participants prepare for engaging an opponent in unarmed combat. Such preparation often requires years of diligent training and practice in order to become effective. The participants become disciplined, coordinated and generally more physically fit and potentially lethal during repetitive exercises for example those simulating the striking attack upon an opponent or the defense to such an attack upon the participant. In that the combatants are unarmed, the combatants will each have the same areas of vulnerability inherent in the human form, all other things being equal. The successful combatant will be the one who can strike most effectively through the opponent&apos;s defenses so as to land an accurately focused forceful blow, kick or the like to vulnerable points on the opponent&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the prior art of which applicant is aware, it is known to train for martial arts combat by physically striking at resilient targets which are meant to simulate striking parts of an opponent&apos;s body. It is also known to provide resilient padding for combatant&apos;s bodies so that the force from blows which are exchanged is absorbed by the padding. As an example of the former, applicant is aware of U.S. Pat. No. 4,991,231 which issued to Swift on Feb. 12, 1991 for a Karate Target Pad. As an example of the latter, applicant is aware of U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,649 which issued Mar. 26, 1996 to Queppet for a Martial Arts Training Pad and Blocking Shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Applicant is also aware of attempts in the prior art to provide targets on padding used for martial arts training, for example such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,866,909 which issued to DeSantis on Feb. 18, 1975 for a Protective Garment for Karate with Force Indicating Members Thereon, and Canadian laid-open Patent Application No. 2,261,472 to Dabney, laid open Aug. 13, 1999 and entitled &ldquo;Protective Target Apparatus to Aid in the Practice of Martial Arts&rdquo;. With respect to the DeSantis teaching, it is taught to provide a uniform for combatants engaging in full-contact karate and the like, where the uniform consists of a helmet and a torso-protective garment having a plurality of pockets mounted on the helmet and the garment at positions corresponding to vulnerable parts of the covered portions of the combatants. Inflated plastic bags are placed into the pockets so as to be ruptured upon impact by a blow of predetermined force. The ruptured plastic bag emits a noise indicating the successful strike. What is neither taught nor suggested is the use of flexible targets, such as those taught herein, which may be distributed over a uniform so as to cover many of the vulnerable points not located on the torso, and which would prove to be cumbersome to cover using the device of DeSantis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Applicant notes that DeSantis does not suggest covering the arms and legs of the combatant with a protective garment having air-bag receiving pockets, as such would likely not prove practical and would inhibit the freedom of motion of those limbs. Contrary to the teaching of DeSantis, it is taught herein, and it is one object of the present invention to provide, a Gi which, as with conventional Gis, covers the arms and legs of the user. The Gi has positioned thereon, flexible and soft targets indicating the vulnerable spots on not only the torso, but also the limbs of the user. In the present invention, the target-bearing Gi is intended to provide a training device for non-contact training so that padding such as that taught by DeSantis is not required. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Reference to Martial Arts herein includes karate, kung-fu, tae kwon do, judo, jujitsu and the like, and is not intended to be limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The kicks and punches used to achieve efficient dominance over an opponent must during practice be directed to the most vital or vulnerable points on the human body. The Gi of the present invention has highly visible indicia such as patches or targets, which provide a visual target during practice sessions for locating these vital strike points as the opponent takes evasive and counter-attacking action. The targets aid in the non-contact practicing of accurate kicks and punches to these areas. Advantageously, in one embodiment of the invention, the Gi is reversible so that a conventionally appearing Gi may be turned inside-out to expose the targets for non-contact practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Such targets may be mounted on or integrated with the fabric of the Gi, on one of its sides, by a number of different methods such as by dyeing, by sewing, by silk-screening or other printing methods, or by ironing on such separate targets as will have heat-activated adhesive on one side. Such targets may conform in both size and shape to the vulnerable area of the body and may be raised, textured or padded. In alternative embodiments the targets may include sensors to detect successful strikes and/or to detect the force of such strikes. The sensors may communicate such strike information electrically or otherwise for gathering, collation and processing by a remote digital processor, for example a remote laptop computer. Such information, once processed, may be used to monitor training or matches between combatants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The targets, then, may be situated on the Gi so as to indicate the locations of the following 12 strike points: Trapezius Muscle, Triceps Muscle, Biceps Muscle, Brachioradial Muscle, Abdomen, Groin, Medial Quadriceps Muscle, Lateral Quadriceps Muscle, Medial Calf Muscle, Lateral Calf Muscle, Kidney and Axilla. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The Martial Arts Gi of the present invention is thus a garment having highly visible patches or targets attached or formed in an outer surface, where the garment may be reversible so that the targets are on one side only, that side generally being the inside reversible surface thereof. These targets are positioned on the surface of the garment so as to lie superimposed over the most vital or vulnerable points or strike zones on the body of the wearer. During practice sessions, the garment may be worn so as to expose the targets, that is, so that they are visible to an opponent. The combatants may then aim their non-contacting practice kicks and punches more accurately at these targets or strike zones so as to practice striking the most vital points of their opponent&apos;s body. By having visual target indicia for reference on the opponent during practice sessions, co-ordination and accuracy may more rapidly improve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In summary, the martial arts Gi of the present invention includes a flexible fabric garment adapted to be worn by a user, where the garment has a plurality of flexible target indicia on an outwardly exposed outer surface of the garment. The garment when so worn covers at least the torso and may cover the limbs of a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The target indicia are positioned on the garment so as to correspond to the position of vulnerable target areas on the user when wearing the garment. Vulnerable target areas means areas on the user which are vulnerable to forceful impacts such as kicks or punches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Where the garment covers the limbs of the user, the target indicia include target indicia on the limb-covering portions of the garment so as to correspond to vulnerable target areas on the limbs of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the garment is reversible. For example, the garment may comprise a jacket and a pair of pants. The target indicia may be sized and shaped to represent the size and shape of the corresponding vulnerable target areas of the user. For example, the target indicia may be fabric patches which are each generally round or obround and mounted to the garment so as to lie flush. The target indicia are preferably indicated by means for contrasting the indicia from the garment, for example by contrasting markings, color, texture, padding or appearance generally. The target indicia may include strike sensors.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As seen in the accompanying figures, the Martial Arts Gi or practice uniform <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is manufactured for example from a sturdy heavy grade cotton fabric so as to resist rips and tears during use. The Gi may generally comprise a separate jacket <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and trousers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The jacket has overlapping front panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>a which are retained in a closed position by a fabric belt <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The Gi of the present invention has a reversible embodiment. In this embodiment, not intended to be limiting, when practice uniform or Gi <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is worn in its reversed position, i.e. turned inside-out as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the interior surface of the Gi is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has positioned thereon target indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> indicating targets or strike zones. Target indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be attached to the fabric of the interior surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of Gi <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in any one of several suitable ways, such as by sewing, adhesive, or the like, or may be formed, printed or dyed onto the fabric. Target indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are superimposed over the most vital or vulnerable points on the body. The target indicia may be brightly coloured or otherwise adapted to contrast against Gi <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and may generally conform in both size and shape to the corresponding target area of the body, which when accurately impacted with the requisite force, will disable the opponent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The Gi may be reversed back to a conventional appearing Gi such as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> by once again turning the garment inside-out. In other embodiments the Gi may not be reversible, or may have different target patterns or differently sized targets depending on which side of the reversible Gi is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The vital points of contact on the body over which, typically, strike zone targets may be superimposed are as follows: targets <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are located over the trapezius muscles, targets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> identify the triceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> identify the biceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> identify the brachioradial muscle, target <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> identifies the abdomen, target <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> identifies the groin, targets <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> identify the medial quadriceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> identify the lateral quadriceps muscle, targets <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> identify the medial calf muscle, targets <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> identify the lateral calf muscle, targets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> identify the kidneys and targets <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> identify the axilla. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the foregoing disclosure, many alterations and modifications are possible in the practice of this invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. </paragraph>

The device is employed by inserting a wrapped candy bar or other treat through one of the openings and into the internal chamber of the device. The hands are inserted through the respective openings and the openings are gathered in any suitable manner about the wrists to seal the enclosed chamber from emission of sound. The hands are used within the chamber to manipulate the candy bar to open the wrapper while preventing most, if not all, sound emission. Once the candy bar has been unwrapped, it may be removed along with the wrapper through one of the openings of the device and may be eaten. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of employing a sound insulated sleeve for quietly opening a wrapped product. Recently, a study was conducted to determine whether opening a candy bar wrapper slowly results in a reduction in noise emission over opening a candy bar wrapper quickly. The study concluded that either technique results in emission of an equivalent amount of noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As such, it has now been scientifically determined that opening a candy bar wrapper slowly within a feeder or stadium does nothing to diminish the disturbance of that act. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There has always been a need for some device that would permit one to quietly open a candy bar wrapper within a feeder or stadium. It is with this need in mind that the present invention was developed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of employing a sound insulated sleeve for quietly opening a wrapped product. The present invention includes the following interrelated objects, aspects and features: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (1) In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a sleeve is provided having an outer aesthetic covering lined with a sound absorbing material with the inner surfaces of the sound absorbing material being covered with a further covering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (2) Each end of the sleeve is open and includes structure to cause the opening to gather about the wrists of the user when in use. One embodiment of such gathering consists of sealing means comprising elastic installed about the periphery of each opening and tending to compress the opening so that it gathers about the wrist of the user. In an alternative embodiment, the sealing means comprises a string such as a shoestring that may be threaded through an annular chamber, extending out through one or two openings formed in the end of the sleeve with the user pulling the string to tighten the opening about the wrist of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (3) If desired, as an alternative, the inventive device can take the form of a container made of any desired shape such as spherical, rectangular cubic, square cubic, or any other desired configuration including two openings allowing access to the interior chamber by the hands of the user and some means to gather the periphery of each opening about the wrist of the user to seal the chamber with the hands of the user therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (4) In any event, the inventive device in any one of its embodiments is employed by inserting a wrapped candy bar or other treat through one of the openings and into the internal chamber of the device. The hands are inserted through the respective openings and the openings are gathered in any suitable manner about the wrists to seal the enclosed chamber from emission of sound. The hands are used within the chamber to manipulate the candy bar to open the wrapper while preventing most, if not all, sound emission. Once the candy bar has been unwrapped, it may be removed along with the wrapper through one of the openings of the device and may be eaten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As such, it is a first object of the present invention to provide a method of employing a sound insulated sleeve for quietly opening a wrapped product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a method in which the openings of the sleeve are gathered so that they tightly surround the wrists of the user when the user&apos;s hands are placed within the chamber thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such a method wherein such gathering is accomplished through elastic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such a method in which the gathering is provided through a circumferentially extending string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide such a method in which the chamber is made in a polygonal shape such as, for example, rectangular cubic, square cubic and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide such a method which is made in a spherical shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, aspects and features of the present invention will be better understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments when read in conjunction with the appended drawing figures.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference, first, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a first embodiment of the device used in the present invention is generally designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is seen to include an outer aesthetic covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a further lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> wherein the sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the sleeve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes opposed openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which lead to an internal chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is gathered in a direction toward closing of the opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by a circumferential piece of elastic <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> suitably sewn onto the outer covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a piece of elastic <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is sewn about the periphery of the opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for the same purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the preferred method of the present invention, the sound insulative layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitable material such as fiberglass, foam or any material that resists transmission therethrough of sound waves. Put another way, the material for the lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should efficiently absorb sound waves. Such materials are well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the operation of the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a user inserts a wrapped product such as a candy bar within the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and inserts their hands into the respective openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with the elastic pieces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> causing the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, respectively, to gather about the wrists of the user to create sealing means causing the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to become sealed and air tight. The user then manipulates their hands to open the candy bar wrapper and remove the piece of candy therefrom. This having been accomplished, the candy bar and its wrapper may easily be removed through one or the other of the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, whereupon the wrapper may be discarded and the candy bar may be consumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an alternative construction of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in which like elements are referred to with like primed reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes an outer aesthetic covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime;, a sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; and an inner lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&prime;. The opening <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime; leads to a chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. Instead of the elastic <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, an elongated string <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is provided that is threaded circumferentially through the outer covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&prime; via the openings <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> shown. Such a structure is similar to the well known drawstrings used to tighten the waistband of a pair of sweatpants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Similar structure is provided for the opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The operation of the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is similar to that of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. After the hands are inserted into the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;, the string <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a corresponding string (not shown) with respect to the opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&prime; (not shown) are tightened to cause the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; to be air tight about the wrists of the user. Thereafter, operation is the same as that of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, although after the product wrapper has been opened, the strings including the string <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are suitably loosened to allow the hands to be removed from the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment of the present invention designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and seen to include an outer housing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> that is made in a rectangular cubic or square cubic configuration. One face <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> includes two openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> therethrough corresponding to the openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be provided with a tendency to gather about the wrists of the user through the use of elastic such as is disclosed with respect to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> or with a drawstring such as the drawstring <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> or through any other suitable means. Alternatively, the openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be respectively provided in opposed or adjacent panels of the housing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in which the housing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is generally spherical or elliptical and the openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are adjacent to one another. Of course, the openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be placed on opposed portions of the housing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or separated from one another by any desired degree. As is the case with the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may tend to gather about the wrists of the user in any suitable way such as is disclosed hereinabove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In all of the embodiments of the present invention set forth hereinabove, the outer covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and inner lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be omitted provided the sound insulative material such as that designated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has the structural integrity to enclose the hands and wrists of the user without damage thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, if either the covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or the lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or both are to be included, they each may be made of any suitable material such as cloth or plastic or rubber. The sole purpose for the covering <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to provide an aesthetic cover for the device and, if necessary, to provide structural integrity to the sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The sole purpose for the lining <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is to maintain the structural integrity of the sound insulative lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and, if necessary, to preclude engagement of the lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the hands of the user. For example, where the lining <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is made of fiberglass material, it would be best to avoid direct contact with that material by the hands of the user to avoid fiberglass splinters from entering the hands of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As should be evident, the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> operate in a similar manner to those of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The user inserts a wrapped product inside the housing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> through one of the openings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and thereafter inserts their hands into the openings with the openings gathering about the wrists thereof to provide a sealed chamber. The wrapper is manipulated and opened and is thereafter removed through one of the openings along with the unwrapped product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Of course, as should be understood by those skilled in the art, the wrapped product can be placed within the sound insulated chamber after one hand is inserted therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As such, an invention has been disclosed in terms of preferred embodiments thereof which fulfill each and every one of the objects of the invention as set forth hereinabove and provide new and useful embodiments of a method of using a sound insulated device for quietly opening wrapped products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Of course, various changes, modifications and alterations in the teachings of the present invention may be contemplated by those skilled in the art without departing from the intended spirit and scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As such, it is intended that the present invention only be limited by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">V. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a side view of the present invention attached to toilet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be seen as it winds from toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and eventually connects up to filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is divided into two compartments, an upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, by divider membrane <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a front-mounted upper panel access door <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which allows access to upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to exchange filters as needed, and also has a front-mounted lower panel access door <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which allows access to lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Lower panel access door <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also has front-mounted exhaust port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> embedded on it. Lower panel access door <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allows access to the motor located within the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this diagram, seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can also be seen. Seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> could include a spring-loaded electric switch which is normally open. When a person sits upon the seat, the weight of the person would compress seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> into a closed configuration. The electrical current then activates the fan motor, causing the motor of the present invention to engage and the present invention to operate. Alternatively, the electronic schematics of the present invention might be triggered by the light switch or the fan switch alone and not be triggered by any electronics associated with the seat switch <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a top view of toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of toilet <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the present invention installed. Ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be seen connected to two ventilation pathways <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> located in the rear half of toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A plurality of small ventilation ports <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> allow air within the bowl to be sucked into the two ventilation pathways <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a side view of the filtration system of the present invention. Ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be seen entering the top of filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Within upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, replaceable filter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is located. In addition, divider membrane <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which divides upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with that of lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, has a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which serve as air passage ports between upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Air entering filter housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> enters via ventilation exhaust line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and passes through upper compartment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Then, it passed through replaceable filter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, where the odor would be removed. After this, the air passes through apertures <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> into lower compartment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. At this point, the air moves toward squirrel cage fan <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and outward through exhaust port <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Squirrel cage fan <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is driven by flexible belt <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> connected to electric motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Power cord <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected to electric motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to allow a user to choose to provide power to the present invention or to not use the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In some alternative embodiments of the present invention, power would be supplied to the present invention only when a wall switch, such as a bathroom light switch or a bathroom fan switch, would be turned on. In these embodiments, the unit would not be activated if a user actually sat down on toilet seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, but did not turn on the light in the bathroom. However, the present invention would be activated by turning on the appropriate light or fan switch in the bathroom. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> I. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to lavatory or sink drain stoppers and, more particularly, to a secured drain stopper device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> II. Motivation for the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While modern technology has given us many advances and improvements in our lives, there are those advances which sometimes are a setback to what was previously used. An example of this is the common lavatory or sink drain. Years ago, the common way of holding water in a bowl with a drain was the rubber stopper. Advances in plumbing technology, metal and plastics led to the development and common use of the integral drain mechanism which used a lever to seal the drain from above the waterline. While this has generally worked, there are those instances where the integral drain commonly leaks water into the drain or leaks water on the floor through the lever attachment seal. Often replacement parts are no longer available for older drain mechanisms and the entire lavatory or sink must be replaced. Also, there are those users who may be looking for a retro lifestyle look and are unable to find it amongst current plumbing fixture offerings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there exists a need for a means by which the drain stopper mechanism of lavatories, sinks, tubs and the like can be replaced and/or repaired in a simple, straightforward manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Several patents disclose a pop-up lavatory plug or drain stopper: </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">IV. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a stopper-type apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use in the cylindrical drains of lavatories, kitchen sinks, utility tubs and the like is provided. The unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists of a round plastic plug or drain stopper <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, adapted to seat in a cylindrical drain, with a vinyl sealing ring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> around its perimeter and a weighted lower or bottom portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. It is intended for use primarily in the drains of bathroom lavatories, but can be made in varying sizes for use in the drains of kitchen sinks, utility tubs, and other similar sinks. A chain <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fastened at its proximate end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to a chain securement means or bracket <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> mounted to the center <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the upper surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of plastic plug <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to allow plug <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be extracted from the drain <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of a lavatory or sink basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> without placing one&apos;s hand in the water in basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> defined by waterline WL. This chain <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> would be secured to the faucet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at its other or distal or faucet securing end <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by an integral ring <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> ARROWS A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depict the operational stages of insertion and sealing in drain <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>; and, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a sealed drain <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and basin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> partially filled with water to waterline WL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> This invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is intended to be used in a manner similar to a rubber stopper, but would allow for better sealing. It is envisioned that the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would be supplied as new equipment on new sinks with integral drain mechanisms, or could be supplied through the do-it-yourself market as a replacement product for those sinks that have integral drain mechanism that do not seal or otherwise work properly. The use of the present invention allows for a continued use of older sinks with inoperable drain stopper mechanisms as well as providing an interesting means for holding water on newer sinks as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Because many varying and differing embodiments may be made within the scope of the inventive concept herein taught and because many modifications may be made in the embodiment herein detailed in accordance with the descriptive requirement of the law, it is to be understood that the details herein are to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </paragraph>

Character B designates a cistern. A person whose hair is to be washed lies on his back and inserts his head into this cistern B to have his hair washed. As shown in the figure, a plurality of washing nozzles are provided inside the cistern B and the wash water is spouted from these washing nozzles and reaches to the head of the person under hair washing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, operation of the prior art automatic hair washer will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> First, in an initial operation, hot water and cold water is given to the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from an external water supply and an external hot water supply via a curb stop, a strainer, and a check valve. The hot water and the cold water is mixed in the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be warm water having a temperature suitable for hair washing, and supplied to the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the motor valve <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The wash water stored in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is sucked by the hot water supplying pump <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and spouted from the shower heads SV<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to SV<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>through the hot water supply pipe A<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>via the hot water supplying electromagnetic valves <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>. After the wash water is spouted from the shower heads SV<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to SV<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>during a predetermined time, spouting of the wash water is stopped and the subsequent process, i.e., shampooing process is started. The shampoo agent pumped by the shampoo supplying pump <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is spouted from the nozzle heads <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>together with the wash water. When the shampooing process ends, the subsequent rinsing process and the process for washing with clean water follow, and then a series of washing processes ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In using the above-described prior art automatic hair washer, when wash water remains in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing, the wash water is drained. This is because before performing the next hair washing, the time may pass and the wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank may be cooled, whereby it may be impossible to use the wash water. Therefore, when large amount of wash water remains in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing, the large amount of wash water is in vain and it is quite uneconomical. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To solve the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide an automatic hair washer which does not drain wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing but uses the wash water in the next hair washing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description and specific embodiments described are provided only for illustration since various additions and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art from the detailed description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, an automatic hair washer performing hair washing by supplying wash water in a hot water storing tank to washing nozzles comprises a temperature detecting means for measuring a temperature of the wash water in the hot water storing tank, a heater for heating the wash water in the hot water storing tank, and a heater control means for controlling the heater to operate and heat the wash water in the hot water storing tank to have a predetermined temperature when the wash water has a temperature below the predetermined temperature. Therefore, the wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank at the end of hair washing is not drained but used in the next hair washing after heated by the heater, thereby saving water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, the automatic hair washer of the first aspect of the present invention comprises a water amount detecting means for detecting amount of the wash water in the hot water storing tank, and a heater control means for controlling the heater to operate and heat the wash water in the hot water storing tank to have a predetermined temperature when the wash water has a temperature below the predetermined temperature and the amount of the wash water in the hot water storing tank is more than a predetermined amount. Therefore, when the amount of the wash water in the hot water storing tank is small, the wash water is not heated by the heater, thereby avoiding heating an empty tank and saving electricity.</paragraph>

When the temperature of the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is below a set temperature and the water level thereof is over the lowest water level, the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> switches on the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to heat the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to have the set temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a temperature below the set temperature and the water level is below the lowest water level, the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> does not start the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or, when the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is already working, switches off the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the water level of the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is below the lowest water level, when hair washing is to be continued thereafter, warm water is supplied from the mixing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to replenish the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and when hair washing is to be ended, the wash water remaining in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is drained from the drainage electromagnetic valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, whereby there is no need for insulation by the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in either case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are provided in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and when the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a temperature below the predetermined temperature, the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is started by the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, whereby the temperature of the wash water is set to the predetermined temperature. Therefore, even if the large amount of the wash water remains in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the end of hair washing, the wash water is not drained but can be used in the following hair washing, thereby saving water. In addition, when the heater control unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> detects that the wash water in the hot water storing tank <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a temperature below the set temperature by the thermistor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and that the water level thereof is below the lowest water level by the float switch <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, heating of the wash water by the heater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not performed, thereby avoiding heating an empty tank and saving electricity. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to collapsible furniture, and more particularly to bedding which may be used for temporary purposes such as for overnight guests. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Temporary beds have been used for many years and come in many forms, from a simple futon or air mattress to more complex &ldquo;hide-a-bed&rdquo; style devices. Such temporary beds are most often used when guests, either expected or otherwise, stay overnight. In such cases, it is desirable that the temporary bed be quick and easy to assemble, comfortable, and collapse to a small configuration which can be easily and conveniently stored in a closet or storage cabinet. An air mattress has the advantage of deflating to a very compact size when the internal air pressure is released, and can be set up in a relatively short amount of time. The air pressure in the mattress gives good support to body members and the air can redistribute within the mattress slightly in response to greater weight loads in certain areas. It can thus conform to the user&apos;s body, is lightweight, and is generally easily portable, even when inflated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, air mattresses which are pitched on the floor of a dwelling, may be perceived as being less gracious than beds which are elevated from the floor. Elevated beds may have less intimate contact with floor dirt and grime, thus be more suitable for those with allergies or aversions to dirt. Furthermore, an elevated bed may be easier to get into and out of for those who may have trouble squatting on the floor, or for those with stiff joints or arthritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Additionally, those who go camping out of trailers, etc. may wish to sleep out-of-doors, but may wish to isolate themselves from insects, snakes and other forest denizens which may roam the forest floor. For such purposes, an elevated bed, which is easily collapsible and portable, may be very useful. It also may be useful in rocky terrain, or in areas of thorns or burrs, which would otherwise contact the air mattress and possibly puncture it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally, the less effort involved in constructing the bed, the more desirable the typical user would consider the bed to be. People who are contemplating retiring to bed are often already in a state of fatigue or unsteadiness in which the construction of a bed from a collapsed configuration to an expanded configuration may seem a daunting prospect. Therefore, a bed structure which requires minimal involvement by the user in its construction, or, even better, is largely self-erecting, would be very desirable in a variety of situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus there is a need for a collapsible bed which is elevated from contact with the ground or floor, and which is both very portable and comfortable for the user. There is also a need for a bed which requires minimal involvement by the user in its construction, or, even better, is largely self-erecting. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a bed that is collapsible and portable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a bed which stores in a very small space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> And another object of the invention is to provide a bed which uses an air mattress which is elevated up off the floor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide a bed which requires a minimum of human effort to construct from a collapsed configuration to an expanded one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An additional object of the invention is to provide a self-expanding bed in which the self-erecting mechanism is operated by remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Briefly, one preferred embodiment of the present invention is a collapsible bed having an air mattress and a support frame. The frame includes a number of frame members, which are joined by pivot assemblies, such that the support frame as a whole expands outwardly from a central area, when a portion of the frame is pulled outwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A second preferred embodiment is a self-expanding bed having an air mattress and an articulated support frame. The frame includes a number of frame members, which are joined by pivot assemblies, such that the support frame as a whole expands outwardly from a central area. The air mattress is attached to the support frame at a number of points, so that when the air mattress is inflated and expands outwardly, the support frame also expands outwardly. An electric air pump may also be included, which may be activated by a remote control, so that the bed is self-expanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is that it uses an external frame and independent air mattress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the invention is that the air mattress can be replaced if damaged, without replacing the whole bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> And another advantage of the invention is that the frame is constructed with permanently joined members connected with pivot joints so that the frame collapses and expands as a unit, and requires very little construction or hunting for lost pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An additional advantage of the invention is that it contains an air-pump which can be activated by a remote control to cause the pump to fill the mattress. The force of the air in the mattress as it expands causes the frame structure to expand and move from its collapsed to its expanded configuration, with minimal, or no manual effort by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become clear to those skilled in the art in view of the description of the best presently known mode of carrying out the invention and the industrial applicability of the preferred embodiment as described herein and as illustrated in the several figures of the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention is an air bed with a support structure. As illustrated in the various drawings herein, and particularly in the view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> form of this preferred embodiment of the inventive device is depicted by the general reference character <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> illustrates an air bed with an elevated support structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, having generally an air bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which includes an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes generally a bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having an entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is sealed with a closure fastener <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is preferably a zipper <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, but which is also possibly any conventional device such as Velcro, hook-and-eye fasteners, etc. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be plastic, cloth, leather, etc. and encloses at least a portion of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is inserted into the entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, either before or after inflation. The zipper <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is then closed to complete the installation of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also be removed as desired through the same entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, again, either before or after the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is deflated. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a number of cells <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and at least one inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through which air is introduced to inflate the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> need not completely enclose the entire air mattress, but may enclose only a portion or portions such as the ends or sides of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the articulated support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which includes a number of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are attached to each other at pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, some of which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and some of which are included in pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect all the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. The frame can be thought of as an extended scissors-frame assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> since the tops and bottoms of each pair of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> scissor together or apart. These scissor pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are then joined in an extended assembly where the ends of multiple pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are joined at the pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. They also allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. Force directed at any one of the comers causes movement in all the other comers, so that there is movement of the whole frame in either an inward or outward direction, relative to a central area. The pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allow the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move towards a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from all sides as a unit when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be collapsed, and to move away from this central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when expanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> This configuration will be spoken of as &ldquo;expanding outwardly from a central area&rdquo;, although it is to be understood that one of the feet may actually remain in fixed position, while the remainder of the feet move outward. In other words, the central reference area from which the feet move, may itself move laterally. One example of this occurs when the collapsed support frame is placed in the corner of a room, where, say, the left rear foot of the frame is in the left rear corner of the room, and thus is constrained from movement in a further leftward or rearward direction. When the frame expands, all the other, non-constrained feet will expand outwardly from a central area to the right, or forward, or both, even as the central area itself will move to the right and forward, relative to the immobile left rear foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It should also be understood that all the lines of direction of the movement of the feet are not expected to intersect at a precise point. The central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is thus a relatively small region from which the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> move outwardly, but there should be no inference that all feet must move in a specific lines, such as radially from a single specific center point. To one skilled in the art, it will be apparent that if such precise directionality were attempted, manufacturing errors would inevitably introduce variations. Thus, the expansion is considered to move outwardly from a central area or region, and should not be construed to imply any particular lines of direction, other than generally outward from this central area. The direction arrows and central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and later in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference> below, are therefore not provided to show specific lines of movement which must be followed, but merely a general direction of movement towards, or away from, a general central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The articulated frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also optionally includes support webbing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which may have hooks (not shown) which anchor the support webbing to the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or the upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and may also have attachment points (not shown) for securing the fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the webbing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and thus to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> show closer views of the assembled air bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which several of the pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are selected for detail views in detail circles A-F. The pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in this embodiment are made to receive <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connections and thus will be called four-pivot connectors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. These are preferably reversible, so that the same four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be used as a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and as an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thus making for uniformity, and ease of manufacturing. The frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> too are preferably interchangeable and of uniform length, with the exception of the corner uprights <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which are positioned in each of the four comers. These are composed of two or more corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which may slide within each other in order to extend or contract in length. This is desirable because when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in collapsed position, the corner uprights <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> must be of greater length than when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is expanded. In the expanded position therefore, one of the corner members will preferably slide within the other, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, thus the assembly sequence allows for the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be placed upright, expanded, the fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inserted into the entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the fastener <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> closed, and the bed is ready to receive bed clothes, or be otherwise used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A useful variation on this invention is an air-bed with a self-expanding support structure. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> as element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The structure and elements are much the same, and when elements correspond to those used previously, the same element numbers will be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The air-bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached to a support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, either directly, or preferably through a bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The attachment may be permanent or removable, by such conventional means as buttons, snaps, Velcro&reg;, etc., but it is important that the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as it expands, is attached at multiple points to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is urged to move with the expansion of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as discussed below. There is a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as described previously, which may also be the bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which protects the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from damage at points where it is rubbed against the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> while inflating or deflating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> An air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is connected to an inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is electrically operated, and can be powered either by wall current or by batteries. If batteries are used, they may be included in a battery pack (not shown). The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably includes a sensor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which can be operated by a beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> or communicating means from a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> or communicating means is preferably cordless, such as radio or infra-red diode laser beam, etc. The remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably has an on-off button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which activates and deactivates the electric pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is by no means a necessity, and the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will preferably have a manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for back-up operation if the remote <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is misplaced or the remote&apos;s batteries are low, or if the bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is designed not to be operated by remote control at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In operation, the bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be assumed to start in a collapsed configuration <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is squeezed together and is generally surrounded by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> previously having been drawn together towards the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed above. The frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set upon its feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is activated, either by operation of a manual on-off switch, or by pressing the button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins filling the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which then begins to expand generally out from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as indicated by the direction arrows <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. As the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands it presses on the members of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which pushes them also in the direction away from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be optionally fitted with low friction pads which can thus slide across floor surfaces, or may also be fitted with wheels to allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to expand easily and without hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be permanently attached to the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or it may be removable in order to allow access to the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by either a hand pump or by mouth in case electrical power is unavailable for the electrical pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, or if it breaks down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an isometric view of an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which has been attached to the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a detail view of the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from which the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has been removed. Referring to both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>, the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a recess area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> into which the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been seated. This recess area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> allows the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to fit smoothly without extending far beyond the perimeter of the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thus protecting it from being bumped or knocked away from its position at the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be maintained in position after the inflation is complete. Of course, the use of a recess area is optional and should not be considered as a limitation. Also, the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be made to be routinely removed after operation. In this case a self-sealing valve (not shown) is provided for the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is also shown, which is preferably included even when the pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is expected to be operated by remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Another optional feature is a secondary inflation port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which may be used for attachment of a manual air pump or for inflation by lung power. This may be a conventional air valve as generally used in air mattresses. It may also be used as a venting port <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for allowing air pressure out of the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> if the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is to be maintained in position, perhaps permanently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of this invention uses an air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is removable. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably fitting with a friction lock (not visible) similar to those used to attach lens to cameras, and which forms an airtight seal between the two parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also preferably contains a pressure sensor or self-regulator (not visible) which detects or acts when the air pressure in the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has reached a predetermined level, and which then shuts off the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This is also not a required feature and should not be construed as a limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the electrical air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be operated from batteries, perhaps from a battery pack. The bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is thus usable in the outdoors or in a cabin which is not equipped with power lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> present an easy and attractive way of providing bedding for overnight guests or visitors. The articulated support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which includes a number of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are attached to each other at pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and at pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect all the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. They also allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. Force directed at any one of the corners causes movement in all the other corners, so that there is movement of the whole frame in either an inward or outward direction, relative to a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allow the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move towards a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from all sides as a unit when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be collapsed, and to move away from this central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when expanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In operation, the bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be assumed to start in a collapsed configuration <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is squeezed together and is generally surrounded by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> previously having been drawn together towards the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed above. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at multiple points, either directly, or by being at least partially enclosed by a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is, in turn, attached at multiple points to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set upon its feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and inflated, either by the user&apos;s lung power or by activation of an electric pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. If the preferred air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used, it is activated, either by operation of a manual on-off switch, or by pressing the button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins filling the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which then begins to expand generally out from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands it presses laterally on the members of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which pushes them also in the direction away from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be optionally fitted with low friction pads which can thus slide across floor surfaces, or may also be fitted with wheels to allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to expand easily and without hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will find much application in user&apos;s homes, in commercial travel lodges, such as hotels, etc. where an extra bed may be needed, and may also find use in business offices to replace the occasional folding cot presently used by workaholics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For the above, and other, reasons, it is expected that the air bed with elevated and self-expanding support structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention will have widespread industrial applicability. Therefore, it is expected that the commercial utility of the present invention will be extensive and long lasting. </paragraph>
