title-of-invention 'Materials and methods for the separation of copper ions and ferric iron in liquid solutions' 
subdoc-abstract>paragraph 'A silica-polyamine based extraction material removes selected transition metal ions from solution in the presence of iron ions. The silica-polyamine base is a reaction product of a polyamine and a covalently anchored trifunctional hydrocarbylsilyl that yields non-crosslinked amino groups to which pyridine function group is attached. The extraction material is particularly useful in selectively removing copper from low concentration, low pH leach solutions separating copper from ferric iron or chloride ions. The product is a durable, high capacity extraction material that selectively captures copper at high flow rates and releases that copper into highly concentrated solutions. '

title-of-invention 'Electrical passivation of silicon-containing surfaces using organic layers' 
subdoc-abstract>paragraph 'Electrical structures and devices may be formed and include an organic passivating layer that is chemically bonded to a silicon-containing semiconductor material to improve the electrical properties of electrical devices. In different embodiments, the organic passivating layer may remain within finished devices to reduce dangling bonds, improve carrier lifetimes, decrease surface recombination velocities, increase electronic efficiencies, or the like. In other embodiments, the organic passivating layer may be used as a protective sacrificial layer and reduce contact resistance or reduce resistance of doped regions. The organic passivation layer may be formed without the need for high-temperature processing. '
